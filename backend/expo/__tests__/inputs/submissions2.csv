Beyond The Stars,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133134-beyond-the-stars,Our project is about the women in space.,11/09/2019 20:49:14,"inspiration

The thing that inspired us was the fact that so many more men have gone to space than women have.

What it does

The code/hack we made teaches people about the women who have gone to space and our website has games that are space themed that goes along with of our topic go beyond the stars and space.

How I built it

We used HTML, scratch, and CSS for the code to create this website.

Challenges I ran into

We couldn't figure out the code to change pictures, enter text, and add links.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I'm proud of the fact that we created something even though we are beginners.

What I learned

We learned that everyone has their own strengths and that there are many different ways to accomplish things.

What's next for Beyond The Stars

The next step for Beyond The Stars is to possibly turn it into an app in the future.

The 2019 technica theme

What it does

It shows some of what girls in code can do, and helps us envision our futures.

How we built it

We began with basic website code that we had written in glitch previously and modified it to fit with the theme. We then created and enhanced our scratch games. Finally, we embedded our scratch projects into our website .

Challenges we ran into

Wifi and many distractions 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completing our website and reusing some of our previously written code.

What we learned

Teamwork skills!

Moneywhys,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133141-moneywhys,"The question is not how we can spend, but how we can save.",11/09/2019 21:28:00,"Inspiration

All of the team members are in their early teens and this for most of them, this is their first Technica (and for one their first hackathon!). They all know about the amount of debt that students come out of college with. None of the girls want a large amount of debt that they have to pay off for most of their lives. They have started saving up, and they want to encourage other girls to do the same.

What it does

Moneywhys will help kids learn the skills about saving up for college in an interactive, gaming experience. The information will be conveyed in video, text, and game format. 

How we built it

This app was built using the app builder Thunkable, a blocky app builder that works on Android and Apple phones. The Firebase database was used for authentication and will be used to store notes from the user in the future. The girls coded a web page using HTML, where they embedded a Scratch game. The Scratch game is the game that will be used to teach children about the importance of money. 

Challenges we ran into

At first, the girls wanted to code their game directly on Thunkable. Thunkable's sprite and gaming features are very new and prone to malfunctioning and updating at inopportune moments. The girls could not get their sprites to talk or move around the phone, so they turned to Scratch (a format that they are very used to) to make their game. They embedded the game into their web page, and then integrated the web page into their app.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

The girls are very proud of the Firebase authentication and the way that they thought around all of the problems that they encountered.

What we learned

The girls learned how to use Thunkable in new ways and some of them learned how to code a webpage and embed a Scratch game into it.

What's next for Moneywhys

Many changes will come to Moneywhys in the future. There will be an interactive notes feature that will allow kids to track their spending habits and take notes on their saving strategies. There will be greater security features and more games for kids to do, that will be directly on the app and not on a website.

Group Chat Decision Bot,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133144-group-chat-decision-bot,"How many times have you tried to make plans in the group chat but no one could agree on one thing? :'( Don't waste your time, let our Decision Bot decide!",11/09/2019 21:59:11,"Inspiration

Making decisions is hard. It's even harder when trying to agree on one thing with a group of friends. I wanted to create a unique application of Twilio services and came up with this idea!

What it does

Decision Bot takes the difficulty out of making a decision. Text Decision Bot alone or add him to your group chat. Each member of the group chat can add potential options. Decision Bot will choose one and text it to each of the group chat members! Making plans with friends has never been easier!


Decide between restaurants
Decide on which time to meet
Decide what to name your fish
.... and more!


How I built it

I signed up for a free Twilio trial account and was given a phone number for Decision Bot. I created a Flask application with Python and Twilio's Python SDK that responds to an incoming SMS. I used ngrok to create a webhook url to use with my Twilio account. Twilio credentials and phone number are stored in environment variables to keep them separate from the repository.

Challenges I ran into

I have never used Flask before! Originally I forgot that I had to include a webhook url. I wanted to deploy my web application with Heroku but couldn't quite get it to work. Luckily eventually I was able to find ngrok and use that to reroute to my local server!

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I am proud of creating my first Flask application start to finish!

What I learned

I learned how to use Twilio's API in a creative way!

What's next for Group Chat Decision Bot

Next I would like to use the Decision Bot in a real life scenario! It would also be cool to add some additional keywords that Decision Bot can respond to or integrate a cool API.

Mental Ninja,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133213-mental-ninja,Learn practical habits to manage stress and anxiety,11/10/2019 00:46:47,"Inspiration

My own experiences with anxiety as a second-generation immigrant have helped me. For many kids with immigrant parents, mental health issues are often trivialized. Consequentially, these kids don't have the chance to go to therapy or learn strategies to deal with their issues. This app doesn't replace a therapist but it does provide an alternative solution.

What it does

This app teaches young people easy, actionable skills to implement over time to learn to deal with stress and anxiety. It promotes positive habits and patterns through daily reminders to implement the skills taught and by tracking progress.

How I built it

I built this application on Eclipse using Java. I built a mock-up for the UI on Adobe XD

Challenges I ran into

As a freshman in CS, I do not have much knowledge on graphics. It was hard to make the application fully functional and graphical

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I was able to foster a clean and seamless user experience through my Adobe XD mockup

What I learned

I learned more about how to make classes work together to solve problems in JAVA.

What's next for Mental Ninja

I want to implement the graphical interface on Eclipse and make the app fully functional!

BillBoard,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133227-billboard,Find out whats the hottest songs of the week by simply texting a genre,11/10/2019 01:22:34,"Inspiration

I was inspired by the data science course that I took. It grabbed my interest in the uses of scraping data from websites. I also have another school project that I tried to use sms for, but it didn't work out, so this was another chance to try it.

What it does

You send a text to my twilio number with a genre of music. You will then receive a text telling you the number song from the genre for the week. It will also include the artist and how long it has been on the charts

How I built it

I used twilio api in order to use its features to enable communication through text. Then I used Jsoup to scrape the billboard webpages to grab the information for the number one songs. Spark is used as my local host.

Challenges I ran into

A challenge I ran into was getting the body of the incoming text in order to process the desired genre of music. There weren't any parameters it just came in as an extremely large string that I had to break up into the information I needed. I also wanted to send a audio clip with the song, but billboard doesn't have mp3 connected to each song. With lack of time and energy I did not resolve this issue.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I'm proud that I actually did a project of my own instead of just doing projects for other classes like I did during my past hackathons. I don't usually like to ask for help either, but I seeked the help of mentors and it helped me progress further into my project. Lastly, I'm proud that I showed up, even though I came alone and I stayed until I had a functioning project.

What I learned

I learned how to use different API's. I learned that asking for help can make life so much easier. GET/POST methods have always confused me and by me having to use them I now understand them a little more. I learned how to scrape data with java (I did it with python in the past). 

What's next for BillBoard

Next I am determined to find a way to link a mp3 file or youtube link to the #1 song for the specified genre. It'll be convenient for the user in cases they never heard the top song before. I would also like to add more chart options and genre options in the future

WORDCatch,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133322-wordcatch,Interactive AR Game Application for Children to Learn new words.,11/10/2019 05:00:08,"Inspiration

You know how Pokemon Go became successful. This time, children will learn new things, while having fun, with WORDCatch! They will catch the words by learning them and be able to use them to decorate their own world.

What it does

There are three steps in our learning process. Learn, Play, and Play more!

Learning It offers children to learn new words through AR models. They can place it wherever they want in the real world, go around to see the whole view and learn the word. Words are categorized into subcategories, letting children choose topics to view.

Play The game offers the chance to test what they learned. This sounds boring, but we made the process to be fun! For each AR image that represents words, there will be three throwable objects with words written on it. Of course, only one of them is correct, and when the user chooses the right word and throws it towards the model, they can catch the word which will be added to their item list! You are catching words instead of pokemon. Why is it exciting? You will figure it out soon.

Play More So you will have all your collected words along with the AR image. What can we do with those? Since those words are yours, now you are able to use them freely, placing them wherever, whenever, whatever you like. You can create your dream house or a whole town if you have all the words needed to do so! By doing so, children will be able to review all the words they learned again and again.

How we built it

We used Unity Game Engine for developing our app. 3D objects used in our game are from the Unity Asset Store since we didn't have time to model every object. Luckily, we were able to find great free assets from the store! For AR, we used Google ARCore API. We downloaded the API and connected it with Unity, able to create an interactive application. 

Challenges we ran into

There were several challenges we've faced, but the biggest challenge was fighting with a time limit. We had some technical difficulties with downloading the necessary tools and understanding them. Since we are not used to implementing API in Unity, we spend some time figuring out how things work. Thankfully, all great workshops helped a lot to shorten the learning process and helped us spend more time on developing.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we were able to successfully use the given API and able to modify them to our needs. We are also glad that we have an actual product since this is our first time attending the hackathon. We also did own design except for 3D models, using Figma.

What we learned

We learned the general usage of Unity and learned how to implement ARcore. We also learned the general concept of AR and able to use them to make an application. We learn the importance of teamwork, through working hard overnight. 

What's next for WORDCatch

Since we have a small amount of 3D objects available, we were not able to add many words to our app yet. We would like to have actual designers working with us, having all the 3D objects with a similar tone and more fitting to our app. We also like to actually implement the Items section, being able to give users the experience we intended to give. It only targets children for now, but later on, we are planning to widen our user to the foreigners who want to learn, offering more options to choose the language such as Spanish, Korean, etc.

lumin8it,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133354-lumin8it,"Light up your world with lumin8it! Make your own light-up, Internet-connected shoes. We created a way for kids to click-to-code to promote a positive first-time hardware engineering experience.",11/10/2019 06:12:01,"Inspiration

Hardware doesn't need to be hard. We wanted to create a way to promote a positive first-time hardware engineering experience for kids. We chose to create a kit to make light-up shoes because they are a daily wear item that sparks joy when they glow! A light-up shoe build also translates well to adults because of the shared appreciation for their whimsy. We created a website where the shoes can be coded via clicking configuration options, a much easier way to scaffold the experience of get started than writing C++ code. We added a button to run through multiple programs and a variety of sensors so the shoes can react to the world around them. Our instructions are presented in 3D so users can understand the various perspectives of assembling the hardware. We have a high interest in bringing our product to market and foresee it being sold at a cost of $50 per kit. Light up your world with lumin8it!

In 24 hours, we created the hardware kit, 3D instructions, a web app to click-to-code the hardware, an API to store the programs created from the web app, program interpreter code running on the hardware, and a commercial with an original jingle!

There is not a current offering for click-to-code capability for beginners working with Arduino hardware. There is a business opportunity to provide this functionality and scaffold the experience of working with hardware for the first time to wanting to write your own hardware programs. The target market is children age 6 to adult. We have experience teaching hardware in the community, through which we've found a great need for this project. Plus, several folks who have heard of our build kit want to buy one. During Technica, we received an invitation to conduct product validation with a group of students to obtain customer feedback and refine it to go to market.

As designers, many of our peers use freelance as their primary form of income. As a result, they are often plagued with anxiety regarding their variable income. Some months may be ripe with client contracts, others may present result in a barren checking account. Consequently, we decided to create a concept for a tool that stabilizes variable incomes into an even paycheck every month.

What it does

Fisqual analyzes active gigs of freelancers, income and spending history. Afterwards, it calculates a stable monthly income from variable earnings and displays the data to the user.

VR,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133398-vr,An interesting story about VR,11/10/2019 07:53:50,"Inspiration

Our inspiration was a VR 360 video on Youtube where the watcher could choose where they wanted to look.

What it does

It allows the user to listen to the book while being able to see what the main character is seeing by looking from right to left, or up to down. It also allows the user to make their own story, as there are buttons that will change the story line based on your preference.

How we built

We recorded separate clips, following a script that we wrote. Then, we compiled all those clips together.

Challenges we ran into

In the begging, we only had 2 people working on this project as our other teammate was working on something else. This caused a trouble as it was difficult to film while also reading the lines for the narrator. Not to mention, every time we messed up, one of us would burst out laughing ruining the clip.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite the challenges, in the end we made a video that looked decent. We also figured out how to compile the clips together without long pauses.

What we learned

We learned more about how VR works and how we can trick each of your senses into believing something that's false.

What's next for VR

VR incorporates 2 out of your 5 senses if you use it at home. However, is it possible to Incorporated the other 3 senses too without going to a different place?

Banking HiTech,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133413-banking-hitech,Making banking easier and more convenient.,11/10/2019 08:23:45,"Inspiration

We wanted to make it easier to pay for students and adults since it is often slow to pay with cash or credit why buying school lunch and other places. In addition, it reduces the risk of fraud and the user won't need to worry about getting their credit card stolen.

What it does

Instead of going through the whole buying process, your credit card becomes a QR code and for students, there is a system for fingerprint payment. This reduces the risk of fraud and you won't need to worry about getting your credit card stolen. It also allows the user to purchase things at stores and for students, there is a money limit while adults don't have any limits. Users can also put in savings and gamble with other users.

How we built it

We created a Google Site and planned out what the app would do if the user selected a certain option.

Challenges we ran into

We had to think of ways that this app would make money. In addition, thinking of the domain name was difficult because domain.com didn't allow us to redirect the domain to google sites. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to think of different options for a student user versus an adult user. We were also able to figure out how to make money with the app. We were able to create a virtual machine on Google Cloud to run Wordpress and redirect the domain we purchased to Google Cloud.

What we learned

We learned how to navigate google sites and more about finance.

What's next for Virtual Bank

We could use what we have so far to make it an app and have all the features we described.

StudyPal,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133420-studypal,The verbal quiz you never knew you needed! StudyPal turns your phone or Google Home into a personal tutor. It is perfect for auditory learners. Take control of your education with StudyPal!,11/10/2019 08:27:04,"Inspiration

Too often, education today is a one-size fits all. This leaves people such as auditory and visual learners in the dark. With StudyPal, people that are unable to read or simply are auditory learners are able to learn in a fun, interactive, and accessible way.

What it does

StudyPal can be used both with the Android built in Google Assistant and on Google Home. Once the user launches the application, the program reads a welcome prompt and offers a choice of taking a quiz based on either macroeconomics, microeconomics, or biology. After the user chooses a subject, StudyPal quizzes the user out loud with a series of multiple choice style questions. The user can change the subject at any time. 

How we built it

Highlight:
StudyPal was developed using Jovo on JetBrains Webstorm IDE which integrates with Node.js. The project was configured on Google Actions Console, and used Dialogflow for natural language processing. We created an Agent (quizlet), under which we configured three intents: BiologyIntent, MacroIntent and MicroIntent. Training phrases were added to each Intent to account for as many variations of user utterances as possible. For example, the BiologyIntent included the training phrases ""biology"", ""bio"", and ""open bio"". If the user said any of these phrases, the BiologyIntent would be invoked. In the Jovo code, we created arrays of questions for each subject. When a student invokes the Biology intent, our Action will ask questions and accept answers until all questions are completed. 

Configuration and technical details:
On Google Actions Console we added a display name, “Study Pal”, which would be displayed in the public Actions directory when the Action went live. When a student says “Ok Google, talk to Study Pal”, our Action is invoked. Google Assistant and Dialogflow would work together to convert the speech to text, returning the default Welcome Intent preconfigured with a welcome message. The welcome text message is converted to speech spoken out by Google Home, waiting for user response. Once the user specifies which subject they would like to study, Google Assistant and Dialogflow again convert speech to text and identify the correct intent. The corresponding intent is then matched to our code which fulfills the user's request. If a match is found, the questions in the array will be sent back to Google Home, which will start another round of interaction.  

It is worth noting that, due to the time constraints, our Action was not hosted in the Cloud, a standard practice in Action development. We instead used a locally run express server which came with Jovo. When we typed the command $jovo run, the express server http://localhost:3000 was started and a subdomain was submitted to Dialogflow.  

Finally, we tested using the Google Applications app on both iOS and Android as well.

Challenges we ran into

Originally, we started developing this project as an Alexa skill. However, we ran into issues with the Lambda code on Amazon Web Services, and we had difficulties running the code on Amazon Alexa Developer. After much deliberation, we switched to Google. However, we still ran into issues with Google, as the basic format we were following did not allow us to expand the quiz to cover more than one subject. We decided to start the code from scratch, leading us to write the code for the entire program in JS. We encountered many problems with the code, especially with making sure the questions didn't repeat.  

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are very proud to have created a functioning program that runs as intended. Additionally, we are proud of creating something that people, especially those with learning impairments or special needs, can use along their educational journey.  

What we learned

For those of us who were unfamiliar with Javascript, we learned an enormous amount about the differences between JS and Java, especially syntax and the differences in logic. One of the biggest differences that we quickly learned was that JS' variables did not have types, and were instead declared with ""var"", ""let"", or ""const"". This carried over to arrays and methods, which didn't have one set return type. After the hack was finished, we both learned so much about JS.
All three of us had our first exposure to developing voice assistant programs, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. Working with Intents and including many variations of the same input was definitely one of the biggest takeaways from developing such programs, which established the connection between the user and the program. 

What's next for StudyPal

In the future, we would like to expand StudyPal to cover more subjects to make learning more accessible and accommodating for people. Additionally, we would like to add explanations for incorrect answers, and possibly include helpful links/videos for further studying.

UFO Sightings,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133430-ufo-sightings,Watch the skies to see what the CIA is hiding from us.,11/10/2019 08:36:24,"Inspiration

We wanted to complete a data visualization project of an entertaining dataset. When we came across the 88,000+ records of UFO sightings here, we knew we had found our match.

What it does

Our webpage displays heat maps of the frequency of UFO sightings over the contiguous United States for each decade from the 1940s to the 2010s.

How we built it

The data for the website was manipulated in a Jupyter Notebook, making use of the Pandas library. We joined the initial dataset to a geolocated dataset of all the cities in the United States (i.e. U.S. cities with their respective latitudes and longitudes), which can be found here. This allowed us to utilize the Folium library to make heatmaps, as we now had UFO sightings along with their geo-coordinates. The maps were also created in a Jupyter Notebook.

Challenges we ran into

Modifying the original CSS code from the template we used proved tricky at times, as it was hard to find the actual elements that we wanted to modify. Additionally, since none of us had experience with JavaScript, we needed a bit of help from a mentor to write the function that would load a different heatmap based on the click of a decade button.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud that we made a beautiful website, with a little bit of functionality. None of us are majoring in computer science, and so being able to create something from back to front, including a bit of data manipulation, was an awesome feat.

Bonus info

We registered the domain name i-saw-a-ufo-in.space for our website (but did not end up hosting it).

Integrate,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133440-integrate,A way to connect with those around you.,11/10/2019 08:51:23,"Inspiration

According to statistics from 2018, only 31% of people in the United States knew who their neighbors were. This number is very low considering that you live right next to your neighbors and have possibly been living there for a few years. Because so little people in America know who their neighbors are, they can download ""Integrate"" to help them meet their neighbors.

What it does

Users can create events and other users in their neighborhood can choose whether they would like to attend the event at that time or not. This way, neighbors can plan when to meet up with simple tasks such as walking the dog.

How we built it

First, we put all the information we needed onto a Google Slide and after all the information was put down, we created a virtual machine in Google Cloud to run Wordpress and transferred the information to there. We also created drawings to show the steps of using Integrate.

Challenges we ran into

Wordpress was confusing and hard to use at times, we had to think of the domain name, and we had to think of a way to get neighbors to meet up.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to figure out how to use Wordpress and Google Cloud to figure out a simple way for neighbors to meet up.

What we learned

We learned how to navigate Wordpress and how to be more time efficient by splitting jobs among the 3 of us.

What's next for Integrate

We plan on making it so that people everywhere can connect with each other and not just neighbors. In addition, we could try to make this a real app that people could use to connect with others.

Strived to automate the process of creating a calendar for college application deadlines. This resource was not available to us and we still could not find one online.

What we want it to do

User opens the Google Form, selects which colleges they are applying to, selects which deadline they choose, and sends email invites to user to add deadlines/events to calendar.

How we built it

We used UiPath to populate Google Sheets of all the colleges and their deadlines. We used Apps Script to create a Google Form with the data from the sheets and to send a calendar invite.

Challenges we ran into

We had some difficulty populating the Google Sheets with UiPath and ran out of time to scale the form.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We went out of our comfort zones and explored new tools.

What we learned

Learned about UiPath and other ways to populate Google Sheets through web scraping. We also learned to be mindful about scaling.

Are you in a long-distance relationship and want to send a message to your partner? Have you ever felt down and like you could use a message of support, but it's the middle of the night and you don't want to wake someone up? Or maybe you just want to remind yourself to take deep breaths when you're stressed or angry.

What it does

Using the Android app, you can type a message for a loved one for when they're feeling a certain emotion. The receiver of the message can then play it back whenever they want by telling their Google Home how they're feeling. This app allows you to send and receive messages from your loved ones, while being more in tune with your emotions and the emotions of those you love. This fosters a community of caring and support.

How we built it

We used Android Studio to make an app where you can record a message, which is uploaded to Firebase. We made an activity for Google Home that asks you how you're feeling and plays back a message uploaded to the database.

Challenges we ran into

We ran into challenges using Dialogflow.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of creating an activity for Google Home and connecting it to an Android App to foster community.

What's next for Open Letter

We would love to use the actual sender's voice in recordings. We would also like to be able to set up the user profile and contacts more and add a sign in page.

The members in our team love to travel and we love exploring different trends in data. 

What it does

Look at past data on Trip Advisor and other data sources with Airlines, Hotels, sightseeing activities, and more which will allow an individual to make smarter decisions about how they should spend their money on future travels. 

How we built it

We used Python using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create the visualizations based on the travel datasets from Japan, Las Vegas, Europe, and then extracted the dates, prices, airlines to create the plots and then determined the trends that we noticed which will be useful for the user to determine where they should go next. The front end UI interface was created with HTML and CSS. We also used SQL to pre-process and extracted the relevant variables into a new CSV file which we used Python to visualize. 

Challenges we ran into

Parsing the data files because they were very large and held lots of information so sometimes it took a while to execute the python code. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud because it was Sraboni's first time working on a hackathon project with SQL and Python! Additionally, we thought of the idea early on when we arrived at University of Maryland. Our team dynamic collaboration was spectacular because we used our complimentary skillsets to execute a project that we, ourselves, would love to see executed in real life. 

What we learned

We learned SQL, more experience with Python, and got an Intro to UX/UI Design from the workshop that we attended. 

What's next for Travel Insights

Integrate Trip Advisor's internal data and make partnerships with travel agencies and data collection companies(ex.Nielson, IPSOS) for more reliable and general data. After collection information for a year or more, starting some predictive modeling for future analysis.

With this year's theme being ""go beyond"", we wanted to explore augmented reality by creating an ""easter egg"" style app where participants can locate images based on clues.

What it does

We provide a list of hints as to where augmented images are located. When the participant locates the image and points their camera to the image, a surprise 3d image will pop out. 

How we built it

We used Unity with Vuforia. Some of the 3D images (Mew and the star) were created in Maya by Valeria. We were able to render a few augmented images as well as add a menu page and a ""hints"" page. We loaded scenes using C#. 

Challenges we ran into

Switching scenes, deploying the app to mobile device, using technology we were unfamiliar with, and time management. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

2 of our team members had no experience with coding and none of the members of our team have used Unity before so we are really happy that we were able to have a working demo. We also are really proud of the UX/UI design that we utilized to create this app. 

What we learned

We learned how to deploy an app to iOS for the first time.

stemLinked,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133480-stemlinked,A web application to help link motivated students to the STEM programs and coaches in their area and to help the community better identify where those students are under served,11/10/2019 09:31:48,"Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from a team member’s personal experience doing STEM advocacy with FIRST Robotics. Inspired by what they saw at our demos and other outreach programs, parents and students would often ask: ‘Where can I get involved? What programs/teams are near me?” The truth was that we often didn’t have an answer - we had virtually no information to help students find teams, other than by word of mouth or outdated forums. It was especially disheartening when the only thing we did know is that the student was unlikely to find a team since few existed where they lived.
This experience got us thinking: How can we help people find STEM programs that already exist near them and how can we spur the growth of those programs where interest is high but service is low?

What it does

stemLinked facilitates team and program formation by creating a network of students who are looking for opportunities, coaches or mentors who want to start offering them, and existing programs/teams looking for students to join them. Although stemLinked could be applied to any number of team based STEM programs all over the country, we used the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) competitions in the Virginia-Washington D.C. region as a case study for its basic functions. Using the web application, students can see, on a map, all of the teams within a certain radius of their address and can apply to teams that are accepting new members. If there are no teams accepting new members near them, students can submit a team formation request, which involves providing some basic contact information. The location of the student who made the request is marked on the map where it can be viewed by others. The density of formation requests can signal which areas have a high level of interest in FLL but which also have a high unmet need for teams.
This is where stemLinked for coaches comes in. New coaches can view the map of team formation requests and determine how many of those requests come from a radius close to their location. These coaches can reach out to the students who made the request using their contact information in order to form their team! If additional formation requests pop up within a potential coach’s zip code, they will be notified to reach out to the potential student via Twilio. The feedback between potential students and coaches through stemLinked allows for more efficient team formation, which in turn promotes STEM programs like FLL to reach a much larger population in the areas that need these programs most.

How I built it

The framework for the front end of stemLinked was created in R using the R Shiny package. SMS notifications were configured using Twilio Programmable SMS in Python. This Python script was run in R using a package called “reticulate”. 
The database of team, coach, and student information was built in Google Cloud using Google Cloud mySQL

Challenges I ran into

One of the major issues we ran into was the disconnect between the information that is currently available publicly and what we wanted to be available for team formation through stemLinked. For example, no information about team location beyond zip code is currently publicly available. Additional information about the number of team members, the age of team members, head coach contact, etc. is available. This lack of information required us to pad what was available with mock attributes like “accepting applications” or “looking for coaches” to meet some of the search parameters we wanted to filled. This problem also meant that we had to consider and compensate for a number of different scenarios, like a returning mentor claiming an existing team.
On the development side of things, we ran into challenges in terms of configuring the front end so that it was usable and displayed information in a way that could be easily interpreted. For the backend, we ran into multiple issues setting up the database to store all the team, student, and coach data. First, we attempted to use MongoDB to set up our database but sustained connection issues that we didn’t have the time or mentor help to effectively troubleshoot. This led to us transitioning to using Google Cloud mySQL for the database setup, which presented its own connection issues between Google Could and mySQL but we were eventually able to work through them. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We were proud of the fact that we were able to integrate a number of skills that were completely new to us including, but not limited to, working with geodata, Google Cloud, and Twilio. Additionally, it was really cool to see the whole project come together, especially since we all feel that our concept is one that addresses the real need to get more STEM programs to underserved communities.

What I learned

We learned how to use Google Cloud mySQL and how to send SMS using Twilio and Python along with “reticulate” in R to run the Python script. We also learned how to work with geodata using a number of R shiny packages and features.

What's next for stemLinked

While stemLinked does currently collect information regarding students' regarding student age, preferred meeting time, and email contact, that information is not currently being used for anything due to time constraints. Moving forward, this data would be used for more precise and specific filtering for students to find the right teams for them or for coaches to find the right students.
Additionally, to expand the capabilities of stemLinked for FLL, more support and features could be added to the coach side of things. Similar to the functionality stemLinked has for students to apply to teams and submit team formation requests, coaches would be able to see what other coaches are trying to form new teams or which existing teams are looking for more support. These features would make it easier for aspiring coaches to find at least one other person to coach alongside them in order to meet FLL’s “two coaches per team” requirement. Returning coaches would be able to login to claim and manage their team through stemLinked. Existing teams can recruit new coaches through stemLinked to help them better manage large teams or find coaches to replace those who are retiring. These improvements to stemLinked will help tackle issues of sustainability within FLL since loss of a coach is one of the biggest factors that contribute to team folding. All of these changes would require modifications to stemLinked’s database querying, data acquisition, and member login functions to improve the overall robustness of the application.
stemLinked has the potential to be applied to any number of team-based STEM programs, not just FLL as we tested in this case study. Based on the framework set up for FLL, it would be relatively easy to create stemLinked databases and maps for other programs in the FIRST network, like FIRST LEGO League Jr. FIRST Tech Challenge, and FIRST Robotics Competition. With additional tweaking, support for VEX Robotics, Technology Student Association,  Quiz Bowl, MathCounts, or any number of other STEM programs could come to stemLinked, allowing interest in these programs to be accurately tracked and allowing the community to better respond to the needs of their students.

Grand Theft Assets,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133482-grand-theft-assets,An educational game designed to teach high school and middle school students basic financial literacy.,11/10/2019 09:32:46,"Inspiration

As high school students, we understand the difficulties of being thrust into an unfamiliar world of incredibly important choices, especially in relation to finances. Because of this, we wanted to create a game to educate others as well as better ourselves and shape the future by making financial education a little easier.

What it does

The main page splits into two aspects. One side involves the actual lesson. The other side leads to a javascript narrative game. The game follows the story of Carmen Sandiego, a young and ambitious thief who seeks to better her future. In this game, she does this by attempting to steal from a bank. In order to do this, she poses as a bank employee, and much to her surprise, she is accosted by customers asking her their financial questions. As the player, you have the ability to help her answer these questions or evade the customers. If you answer correctly, you help Carmen successfully pull of her heist, all the while, learning more about and practicing your financial knowledge. If you answer incorrectly, she is sent back to the beginning, desperate the try again and give you another chance to succeed.

How we built it

The backend for this website was written using express js. The pages were created with HTML and CSS, and interactions between the pages were run using AJAX. The game itself was written using javascript. The server is hosted on amazon web services, and was later put onto the domain, grandtheftassets.tech.

Challenges we ran into

We had never used Amazon Web Services before and did not begin to introduce it until the website was mostly finished. This caused us to run into issues during the integration process.
Furthermore, this was our first time using a canvas in javascript and attempting to understand the intricacies of redrawing sprites and frames was a long learning process.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Successfully implementing the aforementioned new techniques (Amazon Web Services and Javascript games). 

What we learned

We learned how to host a website on Amazon Web Services (using lightsail), how to create a javascript game, and how to run an express server on the localhost. 

What's next for Grand Theft Assets

We hope to integrate databased into our website to further diversify the content we can teach or asses. We would also like to make the game more complicated by adding in randomized questions and more mobility for the characters. We would also like to improve navigation within the game pages.

Alternative Data Exploration: NYC Education,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133486-alternative-data-exploration-nyc-education,"Environmental Neuroscience discusses the effects an individual's environment can have on behavior and health. Does this have applications to Education? (No, but it was still fun analyzing data :^) )",11/10/2019 09:38:23,"Last spring, in a psychology class called ""Mind"", I had a professor lecture about Environmental Neuroscience. She talked about effects an individual's environment can have on behavior and health, and one of the most striking examples she presented was a study on Public Housing in Chicago. In their research, Taylor, Kuo and Sullivan (2001)(""http://lhhl.illinois.edu/all.scientific.articles.htm"") studied views from windows in Robert Taylor Public Housing and classified them as either having good or poor nature views. They found that better nature views correlated with better memory, attention, and self-discipline in the children who lived in the Public Housing.

While looking though Open Source Data to see what kinds of data might be interesting to play with, I came across the NYC 2015 Tree Census Data. This dataset lists over 683k trees and their precise location. Coupled with education data that NYC has, I thought this could potentially be an interesting use case to see how alternative data could be applied in new way to reframe and rethink about problem spaces.

Going into the project, I didn't expect to find high correlation between the two, but education outcomes is a complex area, and the possibility of figuring out new connections in the world drove me to try something ~ creative ~ . I did not find any statistically significant relationships between trees in NYC and high school outcomes, and I now realized that even though I did include several other predictors into my model there are many, many, many predictors. It was fun to think of an interesting (although perhaps a little too outside the box) hypothesis, and go through the data to see if it could in fact be valid. 

I had a good time working with the data -- cleaning, analyzing, visualizing -- regardless of not having come up with anything particularly insightful !

It allows us to save money, reduce food waste, and have a better understanding of what we’re consuming. 

HomeChef strives to encourage more people to start learning how to cook. Even though our fridges are always filled with random ingredients, we often have no idea of what to do with them. This software aims to help users decide what food they can make with their current ingredients, and it provides a detailed recipe for every option. Moreover, users will be able to share their cooking experience with other people in order to support and help each other grow. Join the HomeChef community now and become a novice chef!

As mentioned previously, home-cooked meals provide many advantages. Research shows that people who regularly eat home-cooked meals tend to have happier and healthier lifestyles. The reduced consumption of sugar and processed food also results in longer life. In addition, eating home-cooked meals can benefit our environment by reducing our carbon footprint. We are given the option to choose our own ingredients over-processed meals. It is even better if we buy ingredients from local farms, which cuts down on packaging and further improves the environment. 

Besides providing health and environmental improvements, HomeChef also focuses on building a community for everyone. In the software, there is a community section where users can upload images of their meals and share their cooking experience with other people. They can also use the section as a forum to ask questions about how to develop a better lifestyle or how to improve their recipes. It is an efficient way for people of similar interests to bond together. They can encourage and motivate each other as they continue developing their cooking skills. HomeChef is not only an application for personal benefits but also a social good.

capitalia ,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133489-capitalia,"Investments and money management explained through an interactive game for teenagers to inform, actively educate and entertain. ",11/10/2019 09:44:02,"Inspiration

How many times have you all heard teenagers complain that they haven’t received “a proper financial education on investments, loans, savings? Or maybe you were one of them? Nowadays, people like Warren Buffett earn billions from investments and we, as students, can’t even figure out what a mutual fund is or what is the difference between a stock and a bond! We, the team of Capitalia, decided to change that. This was the beginning of capitalia! 

capitalia:

capital - wealth in the form of money or other assets owned by a person or organization or available or contributed for a particular purpose such as starting a company or investing.

-ia -  suffix which forms abstract nouns of feminine gender.

What it does

We came up with an idea to build a platform in the form of a web application for teenagers that will be used to inform, actively educate, inspire to achieve more while entertaining at the same time! In the beginning, the user can choose from three sub-games which will educate teenagers about Investments, Loans, Savings. But don’t be discouraged, the experience is entertaining and engaging: 

When the user clicks on each, they will be transferred to an interactive game which will include puzzles, crosswords, trivia quizzes, pop-up challenges, and many other things.

In order to educate them about investments, the gamer will initially have 3000$ and they will have 5 investing options ordered in terms of risk to choose from: 

1. Treasury bills
2. Cash deposit into a bank
3. Bonds
4. Mutual funds
5. Shares

In case the gamer doesn’t know about a type of investment, they can simply click on it and the explanation pops up with a real-world example based on the data from opensource: World Bank Open Data. 

Next, they have an option to invest portions of their money, where they will decide what would be the best option for them. The user hits the “Deposit"" the money option, activating the simulation which will determine if they gained or lost their money. The simulation will then run and will show the result based on the market situation. 

In the future, we will make it even more interactive by adding an animated girl who will be a news reporter and will tell the news about the current market. Thus, we will not give out the explanation for their loss, rather they will have to figure out themselves as if they have invested the money and can hear the news from TV. There will be four runs (quarters of the year), after which the gamer will either lose or gain money. 

The ultimate goal is not to gain money, rather not to lose the 3000$ they had or not to lose even more. 

How we built it

We built this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We first built the homepage, which just consisted of the contact info, then we built the actual game page, which consisted of boxes that allowed for user input, and they could input how much they wanted to invest. 

Challenges we ran into

Some challenges we ran into was the time constraint. We were originally going to make it more complicated, with animations, pictures, and use machine learning to gather open source data related to real world finance. However, since we had the time constraint, we were unable to do so, and just made it a game where users submitted how much they invested, and got out the risk factor. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Since for the majority of the team, this was the first hack, we are extremely proud of our baby Capitalia, which was initially put on the table during the brainstorming. It has grown just as much as every one of us did: we communicated and united as a team by bringing the best skills from each of us and helping out to fill those areas we identified as our “weak” ones. 

What we learned

We learned that in order to dream big, we need to work hard. Since the time constraint was only 24 hours, we had to adjust our expectations according to our skillset which has definitely grown, but it was not enough to create an interactive game just yet. Instead, we focused on getting as far as we can, which was one of the major things we had to realize in order to perform our best. 

What's next for capitalia

We will work on improving the “Investment” game first, we will add an animated girl which will announce the world news as the text is being typed. Then, it will be time for the other two games. During the simulation runs or transactions, we will input quotes from famous people, interesting facts, “statistics of the day”. Moving forward, it would be amazing if we can also create an app that can be downloaded on IOS or Play Market.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

What we learned

What's next for QuickMeal

As four college students, we have experienced and witness first hand the negative consequences of the college debt crisis. Understanding the limitations we have changing direct fees in place by the institution, we looked to mitigate this problem by tackling one of the major indirect fees students have to pay: food. The academic success of a student is significantly stunted when they have limited access to food. What makes this problem more frustrating is that other students on campus sometimes have an excess of food that goes to waste. This is demonstrated through the surplus of unused meal swipes that some students have throughout the year. QuickMeal, a mobile application designed to facilitate the exchange of meals, is our solution to stabilizing the imbalance between students who have too many swipes and students who have too little. 

Through this experience, we had the opportunity to learn about the destructive and detrimental effects of food insecurity. Additionally, we learned  how to use and explored Adobe software, Twine, and Eclipse to helped us solve the problem the way we see fit. When building Quickmeal, our major roadblocks came from building the app on Android Studio and Eclipse. Despite not being able to successfully use Android Studio, we challenged ourselves to find other solutions to demonstrate QuickMeal's functionality. Ultimately, we hope to see QuickMeal's success beyond the hackathon to help tackle this problem.

FinTot,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133499-fintot,Our app helps new parents build financial literacy skills through budgeting. ,11/10/2019 09:56:29,"Inspiration

We know new parenthood can be expensive, so we designed an app that helps you navigate through expenses. 

What it does

It creates a projected budget based on answers to a survey and keeping updated with how much money is being spent and what it is going to. It also gives some support by teaching or guiding parents through financial literacy.

How I built it

we created the prototype through Figma.

Challenges I ran into

some of the challenges that we encountered was knowing what to use to start the application going. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

An accomplishment that we are proud of is having come up with the idea and having figured out which software to use to start the project with.

What I learned

We have learned that creating an application is more complicated in-depth that we thought it would be.

What's next for FinTot

The next thing for FinTot is finishing the prototype to start creating the application.

Applying different classification methods to predict the category of the loan status.,11/10/2019 09:59:41,"Inspiration

Our interest in Machine learning and data science inspired us to work on Financial dataset and get meaningful insights from it.

What it does

We have used Fannie Mae's open-source housing market data over a 15-year time period. The project analyzes and visualizes the dataset, in order to derive meaningful insights from it. Apart from data visualization, we have also used different classification methods such as Random Forest classifier, XGBoost and Logistic Regression to predict the status of the loan.

How we built it

Python was the primary language used in this project. We used various Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc.. for data analysis, classification and visualization.

Challenges we ran into

Understanding the housing loan concepts, Finding the relevant features for the classification model, dimensionality reduction and subsetting the dataset using Pandas.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Data Visualization and successful implementation of different classification models to predict loan status.

What we learned

Basic terms used in housing Loans. Implementation of classification model to predict loan status.

What's next for The Fate of the Housing Loan

Implementation of Neural Networks to predict the status of the loan and more detailed graphs covering every important meaningful information that could be derived from the data.

Can You Be a Millionaire?,11/10/2019 10:08:56,"When  we came to Technica we decided to try something new this year. We took a look at the challenges and agreed on making a financial education game. We created a first person game that talks about tips and things you should do when learning about financial literacy, we tried to make a new way of teaching, a fun interactive way of teaching. We began first with simple python but we wanted it to be more visual so we found the app called Ren'Py. Ren'Py is an app that runs on python but also simplifies it a bit to make the process smoother. We ran into a few programming issues with the code but after some debugging we were able to get through those issues. We are proud that we were able to get it to a state where it looks both fun and interesting to play. We learned many things along the way; we learned how to use python better, we learned how to use Ren'Py to make it more visual, lastly we learned how to work better as a team. We want to continue and make this into a real app for people to play and learn, I found myself wanting to play this game because how interesting it was and how it would help me save money, I hope others will feel the same way about our program too, we want to complete this when we find more time and make it a wonderful fun new way to learn! Maybe we could expand beyond just finance and simple interactions as well.

YAPP -- Yet Another Podcast Player,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133516-yapp-yet-another-podcast-player,The C++ Podcast Player that Just works,11/10/2019 10:09:42,"Inspiration

I've tried many different podcast players on the linux desktop, but all of them either:


Are webapps, which I don't like because I prefer native apps.
Don't keep track of where I stopped when I was listening to the podcast last.
Don't fit with my desktop theme.


What it does

YAPP is a terminal-based podcast player made to solve these issues.

How I built it

YAPP is built in C++ and cmake, with mpv as a backend for audio and git as version control. It's built around parsing podcast XML files and downloading + playing the episodes within.

Challenges I ran into

I'm all alone, so keeping up with the time restraint was hard, especially in a language like C++. Stuff that might be simple in a language like python, such as writing a GUI or playing audio, ended up taking hours in C++. If I had someone else helping me create the GUI, there may have been one ready by the end of Technica! Unfortunately, right now, there's just a temporary text interface.

Also, Object Persistence was something I didn't even have a chance to touch, which means YAPP is really a one-and-done application. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Fitting the mpv backend into YAPP was TIGHT. Just barely worked, and heck, I still barely have any idea what I coded. Also, my backend work on parsing XML and getting episodes is really clean! Love that.

What I learned

Tip: Don't use a C++ for project with a time-constraint when you don't have any teammates.

I mean, I still had a lot of fun! I love coding in C++. But jeeeeeeze. At the very least, I should've aimed for something a bit smaller. 

What's next for YAPP

First things first, get mpv to seek the spot I was last playing the podcast at. From there, get object persistence working. Finally, a proper GUI! And by proper, I mean using ncurses, but, you know. Better than ""input a number.""

EveryoneCanCode,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133519-everyonecancode,beginner to choose programming language to learn and build their confidence in coding,11/10/2019 10:12:17,"Coding is a skill everyone can acquire. It goes beyond gender and age.

When a beginner or someone wants to learn programming, the first question should always be which programming language I learn first? Nowadays there's so many information, you may be overwhelmed and have no idea what to do. Someone may have a friend using java, she or he then just begin to learn it even if python or CSS may be a better choice for her/him. They may make the wrong choice and give up. 

I first learn java 3 months ago. I just run into a java Bootcamp and start to learn it.  I'm lucky enough that I'm good at it and enjoy learning it. But I'm not good at CSS and HTML. As a beginner If I choose to learn CSS and HTML first I may lose my passion and give.

Some people are interested in coding, But they may think themselves not smart enough or scared off by some thoughts like ""I'm too old to learn it"", ""I'm a female, should I learn it?"".  

What it does

EveryCanCode will help beginners and people who want to learn coding choose a programming language to learn which meets their situations and build their confidence in coding.

How I built it

I use flutter and Dart to build this mobile app. It's a powerful language you can use the same code base for both iOS and Android platform. I also use google cloud and firebase auth. I also use plugins to embed youtube in my app. 

Challenges I ran into

I started to learn flutter and Dart 3 days ago. I'm not very familiar with it. There are so many things I want to do. The IOS configuration has some issue, Android is working perfectly. My English is not good enough. I have difficulty writing this description. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

You're not A-Loan,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133528-you-re-not-a-loan,Financial tool aimed at risk prediction of loan amortization. ,11/10/2019 10:19:16,"Inspiration

We know how stressful dealing with financial decisions, especially when taking out loans is for most people. Although we have large datasets giving us information on how an individual repays their long/short term loan, extracting useful data and conclusions can be a hard task. This was why we challenged ourselves to try and make sense of one example dataset in order to guide individuals to make more responsible, well-rounded decisions. 

What it does

The webpage extracts multiple fields from four datasets made available by Fannie Mae. It visualizes the data based on some categories such as FICO score, State, Term of the loan and etc. 

How We built it

We first wrote a python script in order to clean the dataset given to us by Fannie Mae. Secondly, we tried to filter some categories in order to find patterns between the data fields. We created a database using the categories that we were more interested in, using SQL. After finding some important risk factors that usually lead borrowers to underperform in their payments, we started creating an interactive webpage using HTML and CSS that first gives the user two main charts -extracted from the given dataset- then asks the user some questions and filters out the cleaned dataset in order to provide customized visualization for that specific user. We then deployed our webpage using docker on Google cloud servers. 

Challenges We ran into

We learned a lot on the way since we did not know enough about anything we used for this project. 

Accomplishments that We're proud of

Staying awake for the entire night and completing what we had planned to build. 

What We learned

With enough time energy and motivation, we can learn incredibly fast. 

What's next for You're not A-Loan

Extracting data from other large datasets and try to complete our database. Currently we do not have enough information to always provide precise statistics. For example, we do not have data points for every single FICO score, or we do not have enough data points for some states.

Pay My Way,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133529-pay-my-way,Finance and banking made easy for all!,11/10/2019 10:19:33,"Inspiration

Being college students, it is not an uncommon sight to see our own peers struggle to manage their finances. Sometimes, we may even have to cancel plans due to our own financial uncertainty. We wanted to create a product that would help students and young adults become more financially literate, independent, and confident.

What It does

Pay My Way serves as both a financial hub and learning tool. Its simple, easy-to-follow user interface eliminates the confusion and stress that often comes with managing money. From the app, you can set budgets, monitor cash flow across platforms, get reminders on payment deadlines, and learn about financial terminology. It is easy to track all of your money in one place.

How We Built It

In order to find out what people would want in a personal finance app, we needed to reach out to them. We conducted a Qualtrics survey where we asked participants about their financial habits as well as an open ended question regarding their thoughts on banking. A common grievance among those surveyed was that banking was inconvenient or difficult. we were able to create an initial design and plan of functionality. From that, we used Figma, an online prototyping software, to create our final design.

How We Tested It

To test our initial design, we drafted a full paper model and gave volunteers tasks to execute while using the model.  During this process, we recorded how easily they could complete the tasks, as well as their thoughts on the design after using it. Participants were also asked for their thoughts on how likely they would be to utilize the features presented in the app.

Challenges We Ran Into

Our initial problem was deciding what features we would and would not implement in our app, as well as the level of detail for each. We knew that we wanted the app to be simple, but that it shouldn't be too limited.
When we began testing the paper prototype, we discovered that users were having difficulty navigating through the app due to misleading labels. We then used their responses to help shape the next iteration of the design.

Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

We were very proud to have been able to go through the entire design process from start to finish. For this project, we had to identify a problem, collect field data, brainstorm designs, perform tests, receive feedback, and polish our design.
We also used Figma, software for mobile prototype building, for the first time to create our final design.

What We Learned

We learned a lot about the design process - from what makes an app look appealing, to interacting with peers for feedback, as well as learning how to use a new piece of software. We had a lot of fun! :-)

What's Next for Pay My Way

While Pay My Way is an app designed for the purpose of facilitating financial transactions, we originally wanted to implement an option to have an interface for more advanced users as well. However, due to time constraints, we decided to focus more on the beginner version of the app. In the future, iterations of the app will become more versatile  to allow a wider range of users to Pay Their Way!

Game of Drones,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133532-game-of-drones,Recognizing and Classifying different bodies on surface of moon using Deep Learning ,11/10/2019 10:21:31,"Inspiration

This is a project built to complete a challenge named - ""Game of Drones"". The main idea of the challenge is to encourage projects which can be helpful in identifying different bodies and objects on the surface of moon using well-equipped drone. We found the challenge quite interesting and intriguing as it will involve Machine Learning and Image Processing concepts to achieve the project.

What it does

An arena is provided by the organizers. The drone flies above the arena, captures pictures/videos and identifies the different objects. 

How we built it

The drone was given by the organizers which was equipped with a high-definition camera. We created a data set of all the objects in the arena. We, then used feature extraction concepts in OpenCv and processed the images in the data set. Later, we trained the data set using Tensorflow model to be able to classify the data-set with appropriate labels. 

Challenges we ran into


Our environment was being crashed due to high-level processes. 
It is quite a task to detect objects in a video feed. 
Considering the surrounding disturbances (like dim light, unwanted objects) in the recorded photos/video, it was difficult to be able to detect the required objects. w


Accomplishments that we're proud of


We could operate the drone smoothly and efficiently.
We could classify two types of objects successfully.
In-spite of many difficulties, we did not give up on the project and tried to give our best.


What we learned


We learned the basic operation of drone. 
We analysed different object detection algorithms.
We learnt the Machine Learning tool, Tensorflow.


What's next for Game of Drones


To achieve the detection of objects in a real-time i.e, detecting the objects in the real-time video captured while flying the drone.

We decided to externalize these women in the MagicVerse using the Magic Leap Augmented Reality Headset and display them in a museum-like environment. It's purpose is to educate those looking through the headset about the timeline of the Woman who have interacted with the progression of Space Travel. 

How we built it

We built this using Unity, Scripting in C#, Lumin SDK, and Magic Script. We also used Blender to create the assets and Adobe Photoshop to create the images.

Challenges we ran into

Getting the version of Unity and Lumin SDK to be correctly installed was the first and hardest challenge.After that we had a hard time using the Dot Mesh feature on Unity so that we could scan the walls and place the assets. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to push the project onto the headset and get input from the controller.

What we learned

We learned how to manipulate the assets and place them where we wanted to. As well as getting input from the controller.

What's next for Women In Space

This website allows people to log in as start-ups of different categories listed by our website. We will be inserting new categories as our development phase lengthens. Community members are also required to provide their desired demographics in order to be matched with the right start-ups'

How I built it

We used HTML5UP we built this website

Challenges I ran into

Not knowing how to code

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

The final design of the website 

What I learned

Learned the basics of the HTML language

What's next for Bridge-Me

Work on transparency in transaction within the app. Adopt APIs of automatic matching modeled after that of Tinder.

Bagel Therapy,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133547-bagel-therapy,"Our project is a short quiz that can tell a user which bagel best matches their personality. Each result was designed to spread positivity, confidence, and make the user smile :))",11/10/2019 10:29:41,"Our Project

Hello, and welcome to our project, the Bagel Personality Quiz! Here’s some background information on who we are, and why we decided to make this. Our names are Sage, Gen, and Neha, and we’re all freshmen at UMD. We met this year in the ACES Program here, and ever since then, we’ve grown and strengthened an amazing girl-gang group of friends who all have so much love for computer science and for each other. We came into Technica not quite sure where we’d fit in due to our relative lack of experience in coding and the technology world. All we knew was this, we wanted to create something, and something that mattered to us, so we would learn and grow from every mistake, so that we would be able to participate in the unstoppable force that is women in computing, and so we could commemorate our friendship, and how much it matters to us even in such a relatively short period of knowing each other. So we created this, a bagel personality quiz, because bagels are a staple of our morning breakfast runs, and in addition to computer science, we have a passion for reminding people of their strengths and worth, even in a means that might seem as silly as a short quiz. Over the course of this weekend, with every time we exclaimed and hugged after fixing a problem with our code, and every brainstorming session of what people need to hear but aren’t told enough, and finally, every genuine smile we saw when someone got the results of this quiz, this project has come to mean more and more to us. We hope we can share that with you today, knowing that this is just the beginning of our journey as women in tech, and that we have the power to make a positive impact on other people’s lives in both the biggest and the smallest of ways :)

What it does:

The Bagel Personality Quiz is a quick quiz that will reveal which bagel aligns with someone's personality, character, and strengths. 

How we built it:

We wanted to learn how to make a GUI in Java so we used jswing and awt. 

Challenges we ran into:

We had to figure out how to make the next question appear on the screen in response to a user choosing an answer. We also had to figure out how to store the answers and points in arrays. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of:

The personality quiz seems to be very accurate! Many users have said that the description of the results actually does match their personality. 

What we learned:

We learned how to create jframes, jlabels, etc. We also learned how to extend a method, import images into a GUI, override a method, and use loops for new purposes. 

What's next for Bagel Personality Quiz:

We hope to make the GUI prettier and add more questions to make a more detailed quiz.

Traveling can be tedious and confusing at times. So, having an app on your phone that has all the steps of your trip would making travel easier.

What it does

It provides a QR code to scan when checking into the airport, checking into a hotel room, and parking.

How we built it

We created a Google Slide that displays each step of using Travel Smart and describes the use of each page.

Challenges we ran into

Sometimes the pages on the phone icon got to crowded so we had to find ways to split up the images and descriptions. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to find some problems with our recent travel plans and find ways to improve them.

What we learned

We learned to split work up so that we could complete it faster. 

What's next for Travel Smart

We plan on pre-coordinating airlines and hotels.

Existing tour guides are tour guide finder tools don’t give tourists exactly what they want. Tours are usually expensive and only hit the tourist attractions. Manufactured, large-scale, commercial tour packages may include attractions that the tourist doesn’t want to see. If a tourist wants a specific, authentic tour, locals from the area who really know the area can serve as their tour guides at a much more affordable price. A small, personalized experience can benefit a tourists’ experience.

What it does

Wander is web application that uses a variation of the concepts of Uber and Tinder to match local tour guides with tourists.

How we built it

We created a raw, demo version of the website with p5js, HTML, CSS, and Adobe Illustrator.

Challenges we ran into

This was all of our first times developing a web app from scratch, so we ran into some trouble while learning how to do certain things with p5js, HTML, CSS, and Adobe Illustrator.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We created a working demo web app that showed what our actual app would look like.

What we learned

We learned how to create a simple web app from scratch and how to problem-solve and look things up to make progress with our project despite obstacles.

What's next for Wander

The current Wander front-end model web app serves to show what that actual app would look like. The next step would be to implement the back-end with the ability to store and pull information from a database using Python. It would also be ideal for Wander to develop into a mobile app for quick and easy access to tour guides.

We wanted to be able to help people effected by natural disasters without using big charities that don't tell you how much of your money actually goes to the cause and how its even used.

What it does

It is a web application that allows users to chat victims of natural disasters, then they can choose to donate, directly in the app. 

How I built it

Used php and SQL,python for back-end and html, css and JavaScript for front-end

Challenges I ran into

We felt that we did not have enough time and connecting multiple APIs to our project was difficult.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We are proud that we were able to create the front-end for the web app despite not having any prior experience.

What I learned

We learned how to collaborate and gained more technical skills to use in front-end applications

What's next for DirectDonate

We hope to be able to better integrate all our features into the website and improve the UI/UX

We like coding and we've been teaching ourselves how to do it. We've just gotten into it and the challenges revolving around finance seemed challenging to us!! So we decided to try to tackle them.

What it does

The user chooses a financial topic they want to learn about. Once they select the bubble, they are redirected to a different page which will present 5 questions. Depending on their score, resources will be recommended to aid their understanding of the topic they selected. 

How we built it

We used python and html.

Challenges we ran into

Learning more about python, flask, templates and html was a little challenging.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We managed to learn a LOT about python in a very short period of time and we are very happy with that.

What we learned

We learned how to use Flask.

What's next for Learn about Finance!!

We need to include more code to make sure our Finance Quiz functions the way it is supposed to. Students in high schools (where finance classes aren't offered) could use it to learn about finance in order to be more prepared for the real world. Adults could also use it when they feel like they're struggling with financial topics.

With all the recent natural disasters, such as wild fires and oil spills, we as teenagers want to spread awareness of the importance of the environment.  Instead of having to go to news websites to research the environment, we have complied information for people of all ages to learn. 

What it does

environmenTELL provides information for people of all ages to become informed of the world around them. 

How we built it

We used ATOM to compile our code using the languages of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  We collaborated with each other using Slack and GitHub.

Challenges we ran into

We had issues with coming up with an idea everyone was passionate about, using the Google Cloud API, transferring and sharing code with one another and putting it all together to make one website.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to overcome all of our obstacles, such as using the Google Cloud API. We also had issues with finding and correcting each other's code.

What we learned

We learned how to work better together as a team to get everything done in the timeframe given to us, correct each other's mistakes after compiling the codes and how to ask for mentor and fellow hacker's assistance.

What's next for environmenTELL?

We hope to add more information about the environment and to update as current events and natural disasters occur. Another aspect . we could add is an environmental fact of the day to better the user experience.

models plant families with webGL (or tries to, anyway).

retrospectivenote: each square is where a leaf would be and the. lines represent the structure of the plant. not like it would be accurate anyway, but just lyk

intro

As you all know from ninth grade biology, the taxonomy of living organisms is intricate and descriptive. However, seeing what that... you know, looks like can be more difficult, especially when you see the words like ""Leaves are often deeply lobed and pinnatifid"" and ""Fruit a loculicidal capsule, often deeply 5-angled"". Like, what the heck does that mean? That means absolutely nothing. Furthermore, there's just so much plant data,,,, seriously,,,, you ever wanna populate your garden with some flowers of a family but not know exactly what genus? Yeah,,,, yeaaaaah,,, and with a 3D view it's just more real and gives you that experience of visualisation. 

Also visualisation is just pretty.

the journey™+ technical details i guess but in a non technical way

All built in glorious, agile, flaw-free, vegan, non-gmo javascript. Incredibly efficient. This has probably been one of the full things I've made with js (and granted... it only really does need a client side so its valid, okay?), and after this, I want nothing more to write in any other language. 

I originally wanted to download the dataset and go from that data, but the bandwidth sucked and I'm not about to expend an inordinate amount of data on data that might be hit or miss, etc, etc. So the actual data I've forgone for now, and I made faux data for. 

I used three js (a wrapper for webGL) to build the scene and. you know. draw the stuff. I forgot how to do recursion properly, so that's why all of the plants are actually more vine looking. I'm not going to lie, I also derped on math midway through and you know. 3d's weird if you haven't had practice programming it). I also made a fatal mistake and conglomerated my math and drawing into one function and totally. like oh man the global variables. why are there even functions, why did i write it like this. 

I had trouble thinking this through logically, but it's logical enough to work. namely the. it's hard to know how to write generative functions based on data you dont have. and i kinda just didn't know what should map to what, and I didn't really plan my functions thoroughly enough from the start so. i had to do a lot of backtracking later (but i was too hesitant in the first place (""joy"" emoji) (""joy"" emoji) (""joy"" emoji) (""joy"" emoji) to even write anything so like you know breakeven).

misc

final notes: why not just write an L system or some like. actual math to faux generate plants that dont exist:
imagine you want to know specifically what Cissampelos pareira looks like. that's right. faithful mathematics cant give you a macgyvered mathematical guess. can't model the inherent beauty of the machine learning that is pretty much the entire universe. thats right. get on life's level.

On average 39 children die from being in a hot car.

What it does We put the pressure plate under the child's car seat. While the child is in the car seat sitting on the pressure plate, the LED Light will come on alerting the parents their child is in the car.

How I built it We built the pressure plate using cutting 2 even squares of cardboard, cutting 2 smaller squares of foam, cutting 2 holes in the center of the foam, gluing 1 piece of foil over each hole, placing 1 wire on top of the foil, then placing the other wire on the bottom of the other foil, taping wires with electrical tape and insert foam into 2 pieces of cardboard, and taping 2 pieces of cardboard together with painters tape. Lastly, connecting wires to breadboard.

Challenges I ran into The challenges we ran into were the pressure plate not being sensitive enough, instead of using paper to for the ""cushion"" we used a soft foam.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of We are proud that in the end our project turned out successfully.

What I learned We learned more about conductivity and how different currents flow through wires.

What's next for Hey There! In the future we plan to make the pressure plate wireless. We also plan to incorporate the Qualcomm technology of embedded systems into the pressure plate. The LED lights with be sewn onto car seats allowing for the parent/guardian to see lights better. We also want to implement a sound for those who has disabilities.

It allows you to enter 3 ingredients that you already have in your pantry and a budget, and then outputs a recipe using these criteria.",11/10/2019 10:37:32,"Inspiration

This project was inspired by our love of cooking but limited budget. One time Zoee wanted to make curry, and ended up buying a lot more ingredients and spending a lot more money than she had hoped. Let's Git This Bread helps prevent the curry problem!

What it does

It's a webapp that allows a user to enter three ingredients and a budget, and then selects a recommended recipe based on those criteria.

How I built it

We used HTML/CSS for the front end, and then used Python on the backend using flask.

Challenges I ran into

We ran into a few challenges with building this app. We had a bit of trouble setting up the architecture to be access publicly, and using HTML forms within Flask.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I am proud of the way the architecture is set up and of course how beautiful the website looks.

What I learned

I learned a little bit of PHP! I also learned a lot about setting up a Flask app and how to set up the architecture and integrate different pieces of code together.

What's next for Let's Git This Bread

If we had more time, we would add a fully functioning database to our app. Instead of hard-coding the values into our python, we would build a database that would be able to scrape the web to look for lots of different types of recipes and ingredients.

StreetSecure,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133574-streetsecure,Make every street cyber crime free!,11/10/2019 10:37:34,"Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project was to build a portable device that has the capability to track and fend off any malicious threat on each street. As cyber crime is on the rise and it is affecting almost everyone, we wanted to build a system that can ensure security on the network at all times.

What it does

It is a portable Honeypot and Intrusion Detection System Software embedded on Rasberry Pi to track the source of cyber threats through data analysis techniques. The hacker's activity can be tracked using Snort and Kippo. If he tires to login or run any commands on the target machine, it will be logged and tracked.

How I built it

We built it using Rasberry Pi module, Snort, Kippo Honeypot and KippoGraph.

Challenges I ran into

It was difficult to create a circuit and make it work on the network. 
The implementation of the honeypot was a little challenging.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We worked very hard and were successfully able to track down a hacker's activity from trying to hack into the system using brute-force or gaining shell and accessing command. We were able to track each and every command entered by the hacker.

What I learned

We learnt how a honeypot can be created and implemented.
We learnt how an IDS works.
We learnt how embedded technology can be used to make our network more secure.

InvestIn - Finra Design Challenge,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133575-investin-finra-design-challenge,"InvestIn is a mobile app that helps young adults learn about investments, keep track of their goals and accomplishments, and stay motivated to save and invest. ",11/10/2019 10:38:23,"Inspiration

As HCI students, we were excited to see a design challenge at Technica this year. The problem statement was open-ended and relatable. As students, we often don't learn much about money management and investments. But learning them early on helps us make good financial decisions. The importance of learning about money and investments is what motivated us to pursue this challenge.

What it does

InvestIn is a mobile app that educates young adults about investments and motivates them to set and follow their financial goals. It combines documentation of knowledge in the FinTech sector along with the social features that Millenials can use to learn about investments, get guidance from the right people at the right time and stay motivated by following people that inspire them.

How I built it

We started with user research, analyzed qualitative data, derived insights, ideated, and brainstormed solutions. We later moved to designing the prototype in Figma. As no design is complete without user feedback, we ended our process with usability testing. 

Challenges I ran into

Recruiting participants for user interviews and usability testing has been a challenge. Despite being in a room full of potential participants as most are busy with their own challenges, we found it hard to approach people to help us out with our design challenge.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Completing the project. We didn't think we will complete the challenge on time due to time constraints.

What I learned

Seeing others at the event work helps us stay motivated. 
Young adults are interested in investing but don't have the right resources to get started.

What's next for InvestIn - Finra Design Challenge

We skipped the low-fidelity phase due to lack of time. We would like to do some paper prototypes for a few other features we had planned and implement them in the high-fi prototype.

What it does It combines fun and interactive games with trivia and helpful tips on proper money management

How we built it We used plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to construct our website, which is then hosted on GitHub.

Challenges we ran into The biggest challenges stemmed from our inexperience with JavaScript, but through some googling we were able to overcome those!

Accomplishments that we're proud of The game accomplishes the goals that we had originally envisioned, and we were all able to combine what we spent our day learning.

What we learned Very simple web-page design.

AR App with Firebase,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133580-ar-app-with-firebase,An AR app that utilizes Firebase for all of its data managment.,11/10/2019 10:40:31,"Inspiration-

I was inspired by the Google challenge as well as the Introduction to Mobile AR Development with Unity panel. I've previously been interested in the concept of making AR apps for educational purposes.

What it does-

Currently, it can receive Cloud Messages from Firebase and can report its Analytics back. It also utilizes an Android phone's back camera and (sometimes) displays the feature points.

How I built it-

I utilized Unity's AR Foundations and ARCore packages to lay down the base for the app. I then went through and connected it to a Firebase project, using packages and tutorials provided by Google.

Challenges I ran into-

The biggest one was the problem with the feature points and plane detection. Part of this was due to trying to use other packages which I was not familiar with, and I probably would have benefited from trying to do this in a team.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of-

I'm proud of the fact that I managed to make something that not only runs on an Android device, but also is connected to an outside program.

What I learned-

I learned that I should probably make a decision on what I want to do a lot quicker than I did. Doing so would have given me more time to come up with solutions to the problems I encountered. It would've also allowed me to group up with someone who was also interested in a similar idea. I also learned that implementing AR was significantly easier than I thought- but it still requires a lot of work to get it to work correctly.

What's next for AR App with Firebase-

Determining what type of application the AR app will have, and adapting program's functionality with Firebase. The goal is it to be more of an educational app than a game.

EarlyInvest,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133581-earlyinvest,Welcome to EarlyInvest! A parent-run app that allows parents to instill the values of saving and investing in their teenagers,11/10/2019 10:40:46,"We were inspired by the desire to instill smart financial choices early on in a teenagers life with the help of their parents. We wanted to help teenagers save according to the goals they wanted to accomplish.

The application allows parents to enter their financial information and track their teenagers spending based on the allowance they give them. Teenagers are able to set goals about what they want to invest in (bike, new clothes, or vinyl records!) and make financial choices to save or spend the money their parents put into the account. Both parents and teenagers can access needs and wants.

We built the User Interface of this application using Figma, a site that allows for wire-framing.

Some challenges that we ran into were trying to make the user interface of the application more interactive. We created wireframes that showed the basic UI of the application

We're proud of the fact we could design an application that could help teenagers access their own saving goals.

During the process of creating our application, we wanted to find out more about what teenagers spending goals were. This would help us access what they consider to be a need and a want. We were able to interviewed 5 teenagers from age 13-15 to learn about what they like to spend their money on now!

What's next for EarlyInvest? We would like to make a more interactive demo through Figma that users can click through. It would also be cool to learn how to code an iOS app.

A Wanderfull Life,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133584-a-wanderfull-life,Make the most out of your adventures without worrying about how you'll safely get to your next location.,11/10/2019 10:41:22,"Inspiration

When we went to Chicago for our college visits, we were constantly scared to take public transportation or the bus and racked up hundreds of dollars in parking fees, gas, and rentals. We shouldn't have to make financial and emotional sacrifices to explore the places we love. In our own towns, we hear by word of mouth where to avoid but in a strange city, we are most at risk. The number of red dotted markers across our own city, DC, as well as Chicago, made us concerned to do good within our communities to help visitors feel safe. So, our team decided to build an app that combines all the best parts of travel, communication, and the mobile platform into one.

What it does

When you're visiting a new city, our app allows you to plan your experience through a whole new lens. You can customize where you're going, how long you're spending, modes of transportation, receive helpful travel notifications as you go, all while being guided through city that's unfamiliar. We built an iOS app using Swift that'll get you where you want to go by the best means imagineable.

How we built it

We used Open Data sets from Kaggle to construct clusters of crime within DC. For the year 2017 alone, there were over 200,000 violent crimes. We used unsupervised learning to train & fit our model to identify trends of risky areas within the city. Then, we applied greedy algorithm on bus stops across the city to identify safest and most convenient routes through the city: for this, we used WMATA's rest API to represent stops along all bus routes in the WMATA system. We used a heuristic for our algorithms combining distance from violence centers we gathered through our model, as well as time-cost and distance-cost. 

Challenges I ran into

One of our team members left the first day of brainstorming so not only was this one of our group member's first hackathons, we needed to do the work of 4 people on limited bases. We worked through the whole night. In addition, we had very little Google Maps experience before building this iOS app, which ended up being heavily reliant on the power of Google Places, Firebase, Firestore, SnaptoRoads, Cloud Functions, and Geolocations. In addition, turning all of DC's bus stops into a graph proved to be tricky, as well as dealing with the enormous amounts of data we had from Kaggle.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We're incredibly proud of how clean, beautiful, and intuitive our interface was in the end: we incorporated Technica colors, a fluid search interface, login authentication, path highlighting, and design. For a 2-person team, we accomplished everything we set out to do and learned so much about UI, machine learning, thinking algorithmically, and leveraging API's for the better of us all. For one of us, it was our first time ever using REST API's, and we're so proud of the opportunity to build an app that matters to us while exploring how to use Google Cloud.

Welcome to Docket Science, the future of documents.Through Docket Science's refined Machine Learning, we will eventually sort through data and extract meaningful and invaluable information about society for society. You will not have to be a data scientist in order to make sense of data. Back then, you had to be part of a select few in order to operate a computer, but computer science has advanced past being unimaginably difficult to understand and is now utilized by many. Technology has now put us in a position where more people can create meaningful and impressive content. Our hope about the future of documents is that it will be easily understood and useful beyond imagination and sustainability.

How it's built

Using html, css, javascript, python and php. We also incorporated Google Custom Search API to parse data and get visual data analysis in hopes to improve with Machine Learning.

Challenges

It was hard to create the data visualization with the python scatterbox package and we were not able to implement it with our own data.

Edward Knifey Robot,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133588-edward-knifey-robot,Protect your plants from snacking cats with Edward Knifey Robot! (No cats will be harmed),11/10/2019 10:42:06,"Inspiration

My cats have been eating my plants, even the spiky ones. I was super excited to get a new succulent here at Technica, and I wanted to find a way to protect it. 

What it does

It is a robot that spins (plastic) knives when a button is pressed in order to protect the small plant that fits in a special container in the back of the chassis.

How we built it

We used various pieces of hardware supplied by MLH, in addition to an ArduinoUno which we programmed using the Arduino web editor.

Challenges we ran into

We were unfamiliar with the coding language, the knife kept popping off (luckily nobody was hurt), the original DC motor used was unable to rotate, the ultrasonic senors kept malfunctioning which led us to switch to a button, the many wires used kept coming unplugged from the breadboard, it was difficult to attach the knife, we had to produce the chassis without knowing the exact dimensions of the plant that it was going to hold, and the char variable kept causing errors, we had to switch to a servo from a DC motor, and we had to use a resistor because the excess voltage kept causing interference. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud that we finished, the servo is functioning, nobody got hurt, and it was fun!

What we learned

We learned some C++, we used our chutzpah to try new and ambitious and demo it. 

What's next for Edward Knifey Robot

After the original Edward Knifey Robot's hardware is returned to MLH, a new generation of EKRs will continue to protect Emma's new succulent courageously.

My partner and I used Scratch, a block-coding platform to make this program.

One challenge we ran into was the unreliable WiFi. When we needed to save our work, the connection would stop and we'd lose all out progress.

One accomplish we're proud of is how we were able to work independently and then merge our work together. We're also proud of how we worked within the time-constraint.

Our inspiration came from our curiosity about hardware and spyware.

What it does

The website streams footage from a (hypothetically) hidden camera.

How we built it

We created a webpage using html and css, and then we hooked up a camera to the computer.

Challenges we ran into

Our major challenge throughout the creation of this project was how to insert the video. The rest was fairly simple, just code a functioning website for the footage to play in.  We originally wanted to use a wireless system for the camera, but we didn't have the resources for that. We tried hooking up the camera with an Arduino and then a Raspberry Pi, but both had unforeseen issues that made it impossible with the tech we had. Eventually we ended up just connecting the camera straight to the computer for demo purposes.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

The fact that we managed to persevere in the camera department after experiencing what we thought was sure failure; none of the hardware we borrowed was working and didn't seem to be compatible with the computer. We pulled through this, problem solved, and got the camera connected in an entirely new way.

What I learned

From a technical standpoint, we learned how to operate hardware incorporated with software. We also learned that sometimes you have to completely re-think the problem before coming up with a solution. We received a lot of great help from the mentors and the helpers at the hardware table, and as a result we know a lot more about hardware than we did before.

What's next for BodyCam

We are hoping to connect through SSH using a Raspberry Pi in the future to allow the camera to be remote controlled. This is possible, we just didn't know to bring the monitor and keyboard needed for the Raspberry Pi. We also hope to expand the website and make it more simple and user friendly.

ForEva Strong,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133593-foreva-strong,Consolidating information to save a life.,11/10/2019 10:44:41,"Inspiration

After pursuing the internet as one does, I found the Instagram page for ForEva Strong, a baby with SMA or spinal muscular atrophy. This baby, named Eva Batista, needs treatment that is only available in the US for the steep cost of 2.1 million dollars. While I can't contribute much financially to this goal, I chose to take a different approach and consolidate their information into a more user-friendly environment to increase the likelihood of user participation.

What it does

I built a simple website using Wix, an online website editor. The website itself contains the introduction to Eva's story including some very emotionally invoking images. Next, the website outlines what the cause is for and what the user can do to help. I tried to streamline the process between donating to gofundme, sharing the page, and hosting events. The next section of the site contains a contact box for users to directly email the gofundme coordinator, Eva's mother. The final section sets up a subscriber list for the family. I chose to include this because I felt that the family was losing user participation from lack of updates and with a subscriber list, the Batista family can email users new information regarding Eva's treatment and upcoming events.

How I built it

For the sake of time and ease, I built this website using a simple website creator Wix. I also feel that long term this site will be beneficial to the family because it is something that they can pick up on themselves to regulate their own website after I notify them of the creation. Wix is meant to be easily understood which makes it a cheap, effective option for the Batista family to utilize in supporting their daughter. I used my general knowledge of file converting and style to create a template for the site that I thought would maximize user traffic and best benefit Eva's cause.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I am really proud of the aesthetic design of the site because I feel the muted tones really encapture the softness of infanthood but the message itself still rings true. I will be even more proud of this website proves successful in increasing the donation amounts that the family is receiving as recently the numbers have started to plateau. 

What I learned

I learned so much from this project, but mostly I learned the importance of community. I spent hours over this hackathon scouring the families Instagram and Facebook for information regarding Eva. With this research, I found the endless outpour of love and dedication of the Batista's community. I truly believe that their goal of $2.1 million is reachable with the power of the community. 

What's next for ForEva Strong

What's next? I hope to unveil the website to the family soon and offer my services at upkeeping the website until they can learn to manage it themselves. I believe this website is a good solution to the families consolidation problem because it brings all the elements of their campaign into one space for users, rather than spreading them across platforms.

Food insecurity—inconsistent access to affordable and nutritious food—is a challenge that plagues our world. We’ve witnessed it everywhere, from the rise of chronic homelessness to the stories of overwhelmed college students who work and study full-time to afford tuition and necessities. The homeless, low-income families, and those who need help the most might not have access to free-meal services or food banks. Despite the urgency of this issue, food waste abounds with leftovers from businesses piling up in the trash. 

What It Does

Secure the Bread is a minimalistic web app that aims to combat food insecurity and food waste by connecting local restaurants to communities. By providing a free service to those in need, we give them meals that would have gone to waste. This also serves to help local restaurants, who benefit from tax exemption and saving leftovers.

We built the app using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. We used Bootstrap to launch our project. 

Challenges we ran into

Our primary challenge was implementing the map feature into our application. We wanted to include a map so that donors could locate nearby recipients based on their location, however we struggled with deploying this feature. We definitely learned more about the backend aspects that contribute to this project and more about working with JSON files for our data.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

One of our goals for this project was creating a minimalist UI design for optimal user experience, and we are proud of our ability to accomplish this goal. 

What's next for Secure the Bread

In the future, we hope to expand our application by catering to more communities in the area.

SMOrES,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133599-smores,Successful Money Opportunities for Every Student,11/10/2019 10:45:36,"Inspiration

There are 187,830 students in FCPS this year. Thousands of them need financial aid but don't have an easy and efficient way to do it. We wanted to create an easier way to give other kids a good education without having to worry about fees or any type of money needed for school events.

What it does

A student can fill in questions and get recommendations from teachers to attract the attention of companies. These companies can grant them money for their education and contact students about career opportunities with them.

How we built it

We used Code.org to create our app. Code.org uses block code to do commands and create the app, using JavaScript.

Challenges we ran into

We had a difficult time stringing all of our code together. In order to save time, we worked on different screens on our own time and decided we would compile them all together afterwards. When it came to actually putting them together, the code did not work properly. We talked to mentors and they didn't have a solution besides starting all over. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of coming up with an idea that could help hundreds of thousands of people get an education without worrying about fees. We think this app could really be useful to many people and influence the world in many ways.

What we learned

We learned that it is best to work on all the code on one computer/account. We would have saved a lot more time if we did that from the beginning but we wanted to split up the work evenly. We also became more comfortable with using Code.org

What's next for SMOrES

We want to improve our app and have our own way of processing money other than using other places like Apple Pay. We also want to improve our UI design and make it more friendly looking.

We also had a problem with the AP classes we were taking and what they would be equivalent to when we transferred since we did not want to take additional classes that wouldn't be a part of our degree.

This uses a blockchain to add blocks of all the AP classes and their equivalent University classes and how many credits its worth. Each university will have a blockchain with their equivalencies.

We used a open source blockchain sources to help build the encryption and blocks of the blockchain as well as get the server up and running.

We had problems with the Gorilla mux library and getting it to run with our project.

This is our first time attempting to create a blockchain and it was very rewarding seeing the blocks being added and creating the chain.

We learned the security aspects behind blockchains and how to connect to a web server to display your blocks.

Our future plans include creating a more student friendly web browser with some additional enhancements so thereis a single place for students to visit for everything regarding their AP classes transfer.

CyberspaceX,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133601-cyberspacex,"Our website arms young kids with the skills of creating strong passwords, limit sharing their information, netiquette, to ensure that they can survive in the CyberSpace",11/10/2019 10:45:42,"Inspiration

Our inspiration was Google’s interactive Cybersecurity game called Google Interland. Google Interland has different worlds which teach different cybersecurity things. One is about internet friends, and another is about cyberbullying. They have multiple levels and adverse characters whom you have to defeat by performing different activities such as trapping the characters or spreading around positivity to defeat them and save the citizens of Space City.

What it does

Our game and website are created to warn and teach kids about the dangers of the online world, and how you can protect yourself from these dangers. We have three unique tutorials and interactive games that cover 3 topics about digital security. The topics are: 


Creating Strong Passwords
Exercising Good Netiquette Online
Sharing Personal Information


The tutorials that the website provides enables users with the skills to create strong passwords that fit the criteria listed on the website, exercise good netiquette online by being kind to others and blocking cyberbullies, and knowing when to share and not share your personal information. Next, the user plays the interactive games in order to test the skills that they learned from the tutorials on the website.

All three interactive games are integrated into a larger plot in which the user voyages to a fictional land called Space City, saves the residents of this land, and then escapes Space City while defeating a terrorist who threatens Space City. 

In order to reach Space City, the user must play the first game: Vol I: Voyage to Space City. In this game, the user partners with a fictional character named Jeff the Astronaut, and the duo must jump from planet to planet, before Jeff’s air pack runs out. For each jump, the user is given a choice between two planets to jump to, one with a strong password and the other with a relatively weaker password. The user must choose the stronger passwords during the allotted time in order to survive. After this, Jeff and the user reach an abandoned spacecraft, and must enter the security key (a very strong password) in order to operate it. After the user does this, they will be able to reach Space City.

However, Space City is in great peril by the time they reach, and in order to save it, the user must play the second game: Vol II: Saving Space City. Cyberbullies attack Space City’s residents with hurtful comments, and thus, the aliens who live there are extremely upset. The user operates an avatar named Avery, making Avery walk in all directions and jump. Using Avery, the user must collect hearts and distribute them to sad aliens in Space City. Once they cheer up all of Space City’s aliens, their work there is done.

Now, the user has one more obstacle: Escaping Space City, and in order to do this, the user must play the third and final game: Vol III: Escaping Space City. This is a difficult task as Space City is being attacked by Lord CS (Creepy Stalker) and his cronies. As the user escapes Space City, he/she, along with a partner named Kiran, will encounter a series of sinister characters who try to extract their personal information from them. The user must know when to accept and decline their requests in order to successfully escape Space City unharmed.

How we built it

We built the game with Scratch (language created by MIT students) but the website was made with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Challenges we ran into

We had a few bugs that we had to fix. For example, in the code for Voyage to Space City, even after the user won the game, the timer was supposed to stop working, but the user would still be directed to the “Game Over” screen after 20 seconds. Another bug was in Escape Space City. The yes and no buttons for accepting/declining requests for personal information had the same codes, yet they didn't perform the same action. This held us back a little bit but we pushed through it in a short amount of time.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We created our project in 4 languages and we were able to make both tutorials and mini games for all three topics. And the fact that we did this is a short amount of time was surprising for us so we were proud for what we had done.

What we learned

We learned how to work with multiple people on a project and code with a group. We learned how to troubleshoot, we used GitHub. We also learned to make multiple copies of our code to make sure that anything working did not get lost.

What's next for CyberspaceX

Expanding on more topics and adding more interactive elements to make a more full experience.

Cloudy w/ a Chance of Cleanup,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133603-cloudy-w-a-chance-of-cleanup,An interactive way of learning waste sorting,11/10/2019 10:46:06,"Inspiration

One issue that we come across daily is confusion between what types of waste should go into recycling, compost, and trash bins. Usually when people are throwing away waste, it's a decision they make in a split second, and they may not necessarily have time to think about which components of their food waste goes into each bin.

75% of Americans recycle but only 9% of items are properly recycled. Only 28% of Americans actually compost. 

The best solution for this issue is to educate Americans, especially children, on proper waste management practices to help them sustain a cleaner world.

What it does

The game allows players to click through scenes  with information on the importance of proper waste sorting. The game allows the player to choose between 3 different modes  (recycling bin, trash bin, and compost bin), where their goal is to only capture the right type of waste in their basket. They will be deducted points if they select the wrong waste. The goal of the game is to commit to memory what waste is sorted in each basket, which allows the player to internalize best waste sorting practices for real world application. 

The fast-paced nature of the game conditions the player to quickly understand how to properly sort waste into different categories, simulating how, in the real world, we instantly recognize which of our waste is trash and recycling. We want to similarly help the composting process become second-nature for kids and people around the world. 

How we built it

We built this using Java in the Processing graphical library and IDE. We modularized several files to run our program, each of which represents a class or page. 

Challenges we ran into

Given that we're beginners, we had to understand the concepts behind object-oriented programming, such as creating classes for objects. A few of our roadblocks involved animating our objects and creating code that would identify which waste items were sorted into recycling, compost, or trash and having the respective bins recognize these items upon colliding with the items. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of and what we learned

As beginners, we're proud of the fact that we were able to successfully combat our roadblocks to create a fully-functioning and exciting game that can help others ignite change. 

Going into this challenge, we weren't completely sure which types of waste were sorted into their respective bins, as like many individuals, this is a problem we also face. Through this project, we gained a stronger understanding of how we can take simple actions to create a cleaner, more sustainable world. And we're proud of creating a fun tool that lets other young citizens of the world join us on our mission. 

What's next for Cloudy with a Chance of Cleanup:

We think it would be really exciting to share our game with local elementary/middle schools, camps, and daycares to better educate kids in College Park about proper waste sorting at a young age, helping them taking small steps to create a cleaner world. 

We would additionally like to add a leadership board feature, and have friends post their scores on social media accounts (such as Facebook), so they can compare their scores with friends. This will promote healthy competition and more frequent use of the game, which will lead to us achieving our goal of users memorizing proper waste sorting practices.

OASIS,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133604-oasis,A digital social media platform tailored to women and non-binary individuals in STEM fields ,11/10/2019 10:46:43,"Inspiration

Webster’s Dictionary defines an ‘oasis’ as “a pleasant or peaceful area or period in the midst of a difficult, troubled, or hectic place or situation.” Despite a drastic increase in women pursuing STEM-related fields, discrimination and bias still exist in the workplace, educational institutions, and online. Our team wanted to develop a digital space for individuals who identify as female to gain inspiration, knowledge and valuable personal connections from others who are passionate about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in order to fuel their drive to break barriers and find their own OASIS. 

What it does

OASIS is a collaborative social media platform specifically for women in STEM fields. It acts as a place to share content, learn about various STEM-related topics, make connections with other like-minded individuals, find mentors, and discover your next career path with your dream company. 

How we built it

We used a combination of the design software Adobe XD, Canva and Sketch to build the user interface and interactive components of OASIS. We used the website builder, WordPress, to develop our final submission. 

We first brainstormed ideas for what this platform’s functions would include, then drew physical sketches on paper of what the interface would look like incorporating those functions. Along with the sketches, we developed three persona models that represent different user types. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

As first-time hackers, we were able to come together as a team and create a product we believe would help women pursuing or currently in positions in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. We successfully developed the prototype, the branding, the business plan, and also a website to display our project within 24 hours.

What we learned

We were able to learn more about the scope of social media platforms and how they can be used as a source of community-building and inclusivity for underrepresented groups. Members of the team were also able to be exposed to different design tools.

What's next for OASIS

The next steps include integrating APIs for third-party sharing to further expand the user’s functional capabilities within OASIS, and develop partnerships with companies to generate revenue for OASIS and provide these partners with a platform for recruitment and global exposure.

ImpactBurger,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133605-impactburger,We want to show how small things like eating a burger can cause large scale problems in the environment. We felt an interactive website could best show the relationship between these two things.,11/10/2019 10:47:13,"Inspiration

The environment is currently a hotly discussed topic as a worldwide problem.  Even so, we felt that many people could not fully grasp what these problems mean for us, so we decided to put these problems into perspective. Many people in America eat burgers because they are fast, cheap, and delicious. Because they are such a common food, we thought it would be much more relatable to talk about them in relation to environmental problems.

What it does

Our website is an interactive piece that depends on the user reading our information and the directions that come along with it. This engages the reader by letting them decide what they want to learn about. The self-paced part of the website gives a more personal feel and makes the user feel more connected to the issues that we discussed.

How we built it

We built our website by starting with Figma, a graphic design software. In Figma, we personally customized the exact layout of the website, the fonts, the colors, and the images. We also compiled our research into these designs. Afterward, we downloaded these designs and transferred them onto Webflow, a website designer based on CSS code. There we were able to implement the interactive portion of the website by adding buttons that redirect the user to different portions of the website. After troubleshooting, we had our finished product.

Challenges we ran into

Because this was our first time at a hackathon and we all had very limited coding experience, we ran into a number of problems. We were able to come up with an idea, but we weren’t entirely sure of the best way to execute it. We stuck with a website because we felt it was doable at our level. After deciding on the medium, we had to figure out how the website design worked. We wanted to use a code language of some sort, but with our experience, there was very little we could actually learn in our time. Instead, we stuck with a user-friendly website designer, Webflow. After making our website, we also discovered that the website looks different on screens of different resolutions. Often times, the images we used would be cut off or there would be a repeat of the same image. Unfortunately, we are unsure of how to fix it, so we had to leave it as so.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite all of the challenges, we are very proud of our very first website. It took a lot of trial and error in the 24 hours, but we made it happen. The simplicity of our design looks nice visually, and the user will most likely appreciate the easy-to-follow design as well. 

What we learned

Through our experience, we learned a lot about web design that we did not know before. We learned how to design graphics using Figma. We learned a little about how CSS works. Finally, we learned how to create a website layout. We went through a lot of frustrations and struggles, but in the end, we were able to create something we are proud of.

What's next for ImpactBurger

We have a few things we would have loved to add if we had the time and the knowledge. First, we would want to implement the information on other ingredients. We only had time for the burger patty, so we gave it our all in the research; however, we would really like to show the user all of the effects of eating a burger, which we would accomplish by showing a complete profile of every ingredient in a burger. We could even add at the very end something that encourages users to participate in events that would help the environment. We would also have liked to make our design suitable for all screens. Currently, our website only looks proper on one specific computer with a specific screen resolution. We want to make the website usable for all users, of PC and mobile. With more experience, we would also love to use actual code to create a website. Webflow allowed us to use simple buttons and fill in the blank values to create our website, but in the future, we hope to create a website from scratch. Until then, we will continue to learn about different ways to use code to better the world.

We were inspired by the fact that even as college students, we know very little about finances, how they work, and what we can do to be smarter with money as we become more independent.

What it does

FinBalance is a resource for individuals who want to learn how to be smarter with money. Most of the intended features do not work, but in our ideal version of the site, the Twilio chatbot would be incorporated to answer FAQs, and the calculator page would suggest reasonable amounts to save based on income.

How we built it

The project is built of HTML, CSS, and JS files.

Challenges we ran into

Most of the 24 hours was spent trying to figure out the permissions surrounding the Domain.com domain name and the Twilio Chatbox. When getting frustrated, we'd take breaks to make more progress, but we were most successful when asking for help. 

What we learned

We learned we shouldn't be too hard on ourselves when something doesn't work. We didn't come expecting to win prizes, but we were hoping to leave with a project we are proud of. Though it isn't what we initially imagined, our collective effort makes this something we're proud of.

What's next for FinBalance

From working on this project, we've learned so much about finances, and we know that this is a needed resource for individuals our age. We will be working towards making the key features function as we know they will come in handy for us as students trying to pay for college.

As financial illiteracy is becoming more and more prevalent, we want to help finance our youth’s futures by teaching them budgeting and planning skills at a young age.

What it does

Funance is a simulator game app that follows the life of a person who starts out with low financial knowledge. Users must use their quick thinking and learning skills to get through their character’s life while gaining income and interest, facing obstacles, and handling opportunities.

How we built it

We built the app using the Thunkable platform and its variety of components.

Challenges we ran into

It was challenging to work with local data in the app. The different screens would not interact the way they were coded to. Another challenge that we ran into was that Thunkable did not allow user collaboration, so we had to work on it one by one at different times.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

The accomplishment that we’re the most proud of is that we managed to make something with our limited devices and platforms. In addition, we are proud of our project idea and we believe that it is something we can greatly improve in the future.

What we learned

In creating this app, we learned much more about financial knowledge and the financial literacy of children, teens, and adults in the U.S. Additionally, we learned to adjust to the conditions we had and work the best we were able to. In the future, we would make sure to completely verify that we brought working devices.  

What's next for Funance

We want to add much more to the app, including insurance, real estate, bank CD, mutual funds, compounding, Web DB components, and user account information. We also want to use a more user friendly platform to build the app, like Python or Unity, since we were unable to at the hackathon (as the devices were all limited in capability). The next step would definitely be to upload the app to the App Store for Apple devices and Play Store for Android.

Fannie Mae Data Science Challenge,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133608-fannie-mae-data-science-challenge,Analysis for the single-family fixed rate mortgage dataset.,11/10/2019 10:48:26,"Inspiration

The coding challenge offered by Fannie Mae. It was a great fit to what we learned in class and we were interested in figuring out the attributes that correlate the most with prepaid and default mortgages.

What it does

This project analyzes the 3rd Quarter Single-Family Eligible Fixed Rate Mortgage Dataset for the years 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 and finds the correlation between the interested risk factors and prepaid and default mortgages.

How we built it

We extracted and organized the 3rd Quarter Single-Family Eligible Fixed Rate Mortgage Dataset for the years 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. By combining both the acquisitions file and performance file and tidying the table, we were able to find the risk factors that we were interested in and could possibly be a powerful factor for the prepaid and default mortgages. The risk factors we chose were number of borrowers, debt-to-income ratio, borrower credit score, and mortgage insurance percentage. We were able to define a value from the dataset that represent the amount of prepaid/default payment per month and found the correlation of the payment with the risk factors.

Challenges we ran into

The dataset for all four years are huge, and we had difficulty reading and running the script. So we extracted sample dataset for each year and started working on that.
Another challenge was we were unfamiliar with the concepts and formulas related to mortgage, but we were able to overcome that by researching.

What we learned

As computer science students, we not only practiced and showed our skills for data science but also learned a lot about mortgages and what could be the challenging topics in the real world.

Globally Sourc-Ed,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133609-globally-sourc-ed,"Globally Sourc-Ed is a digital source of easily accessible, reliable global news and resources. It is designed to promote global education and media literacy for people of all ages and backgrounds.",11/10/2019 10:49:57,"Inspiration

Last year, I had the opportunity to create a project for an English class that focused on the importance of global education and how to implement it in schools. As someone who is passionate about the world and the many cultures and communities that are a part of it, I thought that it would be an excellent learning experience for me to try to create a source for others to learn about some of what I have learned. Global education is so necessary to our society, yet it is hardly ever taught, and when it is, there is often a lack of media literacy teaching.

What it does

The home page contains an interactive map where users can select a continent they are interested in seeing the news for. They are then transported to a page for that continent where a menu of smaller regions are displayed. They can choose a region from this page, and then are presented with news sources for that region. Each news source is accompanied by a descriptor of bias, so that users are informed about political leanings before they go to that source.

How I built it

I am an amateur, so I used a website creator (Wix.com) that allowed me to place some design elements into the site without coding, but also allowed me to alter those aspects or code other aspects of the site. I used Wix's API manual as well as YouTube videos and several helpful articles about working with JavaScript.

Challenges I ran into

There were a few points where certain tasks would not perform as I wanted them to when I previewed them on the site. I had help from several mentors as well as the online research I did. I did not get as far in developing the site as I wanted to, but I am more aware of how to work efficiently next time now that I have more knowledge.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I am extremely proud of myself for taking the initiative to learn more about coding and to put in the time and effort to work on a project I am truly passionate about. I am also proud of myself for submitting and demoing, as I know my work is not nearly as complex as so many other hackers here, but it is still something I want to share.

What I learned

I learned more about coding in JavaScript, as well as more about developing a website. I also improved my troubleshooting abilities. I learned that it is okay to ask for help and that it is often helpful to ask other hackers for advice, assistance, and/or inspiration.

What's next for Globally Sourc-Ed

I would really like to continue working on this site at home in order to be able to share it with others for their own use. I think a tool like this could be extremely useful in schools, even if it is not my specific page. I would love to spread the word about this source.

Portfolio Web-App,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133610-portfolio-web-app,This is an intuitive web-app made to present information in a way that is very clean and easy to read. ,11/10/2019 10:50:02,"Inspiration

We were inspired by trying to find a unique and neat way to display projects in a way that makes it easier for us to present, and in a way that gives the user a good experience when learning about our projects. 

What it does

This web-app is a tabbed page where all of our projects are neatly organized into tabs to allow the user to easily learn about what we did. 

How we built it

We built this app using create-react-app which uses JSX to create an interface. A CSS stylesheet was used to format every component.

Challenges we ran into

One challenge was working with node.js and react. Before the hackathon, no one in our group knew how to code in Javascript or use node.js, so overcoming this learning curve was difficult. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of learning to use react to build our own web apps and include smooth transitions to enhance user experience. 

What we learned

We learned how to create tabs using react so that it is not necessary to create a new webpage for different contents. This allowed a smooth transition between pages that we sought. 
Aesthetics and animations are important parts of a web-app along with functionality. Both play a vital role in the user's overall experience. 

What's next for Presentation Web-App

We are considering adding more visuals to our web-app portfolio to enhance anyone's need to display information. Visuals will make it easier to grasp concepts and allow the user to digest information. For example, a flowchart would make it easier to help readers learn our design process for our projects. Additionally, we hope to add more pages as we complete more projects.
 Such a web-app can be very useful for people who want to make unique presentations or portfolios for their own projects, which can help share inventive projects within the community as well as help freelancers sell their products and become more marketable .

~~Galaxy MilkyWay~~,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133611-galaxy-milkyway,CLI for AprilTag and Google FireStore,11/10/2019 10:50:09,"Inspiration

In the space industry, there is no standardized tracking system between organizations to keep track of equipment being sent into space (and possibly becoming debris). In order to make space travel safer and help scientists keep track of their equipment, we decided to build a database using Google FireStore.

What it does

This simple command line interface allows users to scan in equipment via AprilTag (a simplified version of a QR code) and uploads the equipment information into Google FireStore. In addition, the tool uses computer vision to track and update the location of these tags through image processing.

How we built it

We used openCV and the apriltag python module to process images taken by a camera. After all AprilTags are identified, their location is logged into Google's FireStore database through Google API

Challenges we ran into

Poor documentation for the python bindings and our lack of experience in computer vision made image processing difficult.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

All of us managed to step out of our comfort zones by learning completely new aspects of programming. Half of our team never attended a hackathon before and was not familiar with Python. However, we all managed to finish the project on time with a satisfactory product.

What we learned

We learned a lot about databases -- the different kinds of databases, basic terminology, and how to create a basic database using Google API. 

What's next for Galaxy MilkyWay

We have started to add support for realtime image processing that can track AprilTags through a video stream. In the future we would like the database to store more information than just simply tracking location. In addition, data stored in FireStore could be used the predict the trajectory of equipment in space in order to prevent possible collisions in space. Galaxy MilkyWay has a lot of potential for not only becoming the standard database for equipment tracking, but also making space travel safer through prediction.

SalarySprout,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133612-salarysprout,Help close the gender pay gap and make wage data more accessible by letting people anonymously contribute their salary information on a public blockchain.,11/10/2019 10:50:45,"Inspiration

We were inspired by the gender pay gap and concern that women and other underrepresented groups may be too afraid to ask for a raise.  This anonymous site that utilizes the Algorand blockchain will be used to increase these groups' confidence when asking for raises and promotions because they can base their requests on data found and stored through blockchain. Each transaction on the blockchain contains a person's position, gender, years of experience and salary. 

What it does

The app takes in information about a person's position, salary, gender and years of experience and generates a performance analysis to advise the user about what their next steps might be. We provide them information about how they are doing compared to the national average salary for their position (currently just engineering positions). If someone was in another field other than engineering, we compare their salary to the average national salary.  We then provide some advice about if they should consider asking for a promotion given their years of experience. Finally, we used the Algorand JS SDK to enable users to report their salary anonymously on the Algorand blockchain so that others can freely access it.

How we built it

React + Google Material Design + Firebase + Algorand blockchain, hosted on Firebase

Challenges we ran into

We had to coordinate amongst ourselves for back-end and front-end. Some of us were completely new to coding in Javascript. We also tried to scrape ZipRecruiter's website for dynamic average salary information but ran into CORS issues and did not have enough time to figure it out. We ended up searching the Internet for common engineering positions salaries and hardcoded the data. Although we were not able to implement all of the tools into the site, we have many ideas on how to improve upon this concept. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Learning more about the blockchain, learning how to code with blockchain, and creating a site to help others step towards more transparency and equality. One of our team members is a high-schooler and this is her first hackathon. She was very motivated in learning about blockchain and picked up a lot of Javascript and front-end development at this hackathon. We're very proud of her eagerness to learn and her ability to pick up new technologies independently and collaboratively as she worked with mentors to get through some huddles. 

What we learned

We were able to learn how blockchain functions work and utilize the concept and structure of the blockchain in order to help lessen the pay gap. Anastasia created her first Firebase auth system and figured out how to host with Firebase for the first time.

What's next for SalarySprout

We will be including the ability for offices to host an anonymous yet legitimate voting for promotions and raises within the workplace.  Using this technology, we can lessen the effects some workers may have through nepotism, favoritism and other unfair advantages over their coworkers.  This will utilize the blockchain to ensure that coworkers can reward office members who have contributed strongly toward the community, and allow workers to be more connected to the financial aspect of work, and lessen the divide between management and people who traditionally determine raises, and the general workforce.

Shroom Life,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133614-shroom-life,"You are but a humble mushroom. Stay healthy, stay out of debt. Find BALANCE. ",11/10/2019 10:51:30,"Inspiration

Some of us were inspired by game development I saw last year at Technica and we wanted to do better than last year. We were brainstorming ideas that would satisfy the reward criteria for the game design contest, and settled on a student debt simulator. 

What it does

It's a game where you live as a mushroom and try to live a balanced life between health and financial stability. You have to plan out your meal plans, time spent in school, time spent at work, housing plans, and make other decisions to keep yourself healthy and away from heavy debt out of a 2-year college. Endings are based off of how much debt you acquired during the six semesters.

How we built it

Game building was done in Godot, Sprite and background artwork done in Clipstudio and FireAlpaca. 

Challenges we ran into

The largest challenge we ran into was running out of time. We also could only have one person working in Godot at a time, so it was restricting on our time usage.We often found ourselves distracted with the workshops, but we returned to finish off the project afterwards. The Wifi downstairs was relatively weak, and we often had connection problems.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Working very late at night, past 2 AM working on sprites and programming.We were able to communicate and reach agreements very easily, we never had any group conflict with decisions and brainstorming.  

What we learned

We learned that we should use the best of our abilities and work using the resources we are the most familiar with in time-restrictive situations. 
Also, I found out not to stay up too late, sleep deprivation is REAL.

What's next for Shroom Life

More NPCs, more choices and player pathways, more hidden endings, perhaps a romance option?

I was inspired by the different FinTech companies at Technica to hack something to manage finances and investments in an interactive and engaging platform. I wanted to build something to help people with minimal financial literacy make good decisions and goals.

What it does

It is a social media and dashboard hub to see your savings, finance goals, and investments. You can explore your feed to see what your friends are investing in, or news they are sharing regarding finance related topics. You can build your dashboard with different widgets depending on your goals.

How I built it

I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to prototype the front end.

Challenges I ran into

I initially had 2 other teammates to work with, but unfortunately they left the event early. I had some issues setting up the hosting on GCP and the domain, since this usually takes 24-48hrs to make changes.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I learned a lot about bootstrap, which is a front end tool I've been wanting to gain expereience with. I really like the creativity and applicability of the idea as well.

Leftovers,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133620-leftovers,Cook with All You've Got!!!,11/10/2019 10:52:30,"Inspiration

In our honors class, we had a guest speaker who spoke about the sustainability projects at UMD. This got us thinking about how we could join in the effort, and expand it past our community. 800 million people around the world suffer from hunger daily and approximately one-third of the food produced for global human consumption gets wasted annually. To us, the first step of the solution was obvious, waste less food to feed more people.

What it does

We built a food sustainability app called Leftovers in which a user can input leftover ingredients they have in their food or pantry by taking a photo and generate recipes that use those ingredients. This not only encourages people to use all the food they buy and create less waste, but it also expands their tastes.

How we built it

We used Android Studio, the Google Vision API, and the Edamam Recipe Search API to build our app. We processed the user input from the camera with the vision API to identify the ingredient and added this ingredient to an ArrayList. The user can continue to input ingredients into the app, then press continue. We then processed the ArrayList with the recipe search API and return a list of up to 25 recipes using the ingredients in the list.

Challenges we ran into

We had to experiment with various image recognition APIs including Microsoft Azure, Amazon Rekognition, and Google Vision. This involved learning how to implement each of these, and testing them. We inputted images into each and checked the output. Microsoft Azure couldn't tell the difference between a peach and an orange, Amazon Rekognition returned the color green for broccoli, and Google Vision had the most accurate results.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We built the app from top to bottom, and the Android App Bundle is ready for deployment to the Play Store to be downloaded and used by the community.

What we learned

We learned a lot about UI/UX, as well as the power of pairing image recognition and machine learning to provide simple solutions to real-world issues.

What's next for Leftovers

The next step would be to deploy the app. We would also like to add a reminder feature that will give you a priority list of the ingredients you should use to ensure that they do not expire. This would be accomplished by inputting the ingredients into the app when you buy them and would require the app to store this data until the ingredient expires.

As seniors in high school, we understand how overwhelming it can be for students to not only work on college applications and maintain their extracurriculars but also attend college or job interviews. As students find themselves juggling multiple priorities at once, we believe that they would highly benefit from an app that helps them prepare for these interviews.

What it does

Interview Assistant allows students to choose from a variety of both personal and technical interview questions. The app will then simulate the role of an interviewer, and read out the questions that they selected. To make the app more personal, the questions are asked by real people. The students can then listen to a recording of the entire interview and assess their strengths and weaknesses.

How we built it

We used Appery.io to plan our app and used MIT App Inventor.

Challenges we ran into

We switched from Appery.io to MIT App Inventor pretty late into the game because we realized that MIT App Inventor had more features.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

The easy-to-use interface and the recording feature.

What we learned

None of us have coded using MIT App Inventor before or created an app, so this was an eye-opening experience.

What's next for Interview Assistant

In the future, we wish to add more options for these students such as planning questions that they could ask during their interview. We would also like to replace the audio recording function with a video recording function so they can observe their posture/eye contact.

Empowering Girls To Code,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133627-empowering-girls-to-code,A website to teach girls to code in order to close the gender gap in Computer Science.,11/10/2019 10:54:01,"Inspiration

Computer Science is a topic I am extremely passionate, and is a subject I'm definitely considering as a college major. After seeing that the percentage of women in the field has been in decline, I decided to do raise awareness of the issue in hopes of increasing female participation in Computer Science. I believe that the best way of solving this issue is by directly combating it. Teaching girls coding languages through this website will enable them to gain exposure of the subject and make learning the skills easier.

What it does

The website starts with an explanation of the purpose of coding. It then provides reasons for girls to pursue Computer Science as a major and brings to light the lack of female representation in the field. This is followed by tutorials for learning Python and Java geared for all ages. Topics covered include writing a hello world statement, creating variables, and writing out more complex print statements. The user can engage in practice problems to quiz their understanding of the topics they learned and see pieces of sample code.

How I built it

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make the webpage interactive. I also did research regarding statistics of women in Computer Science to provide evidence of the growing issue. I incorporated related images such as a graph of female participation in Computer Science compared to other majors.

Challenges I ran into

Making a quiz that tests the user on their Python skills was difficult. There were many conditions that had to be met and multiple variables. Incorporating stylistic features such as making the answer choices turn red when the wrong answer was submitted or green when the correct answer was submitted were very time-consuming.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I'm proud of my ability to make a program using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to teach Java and Python. It really allowed me to solidify my understanding of a variety of languages. Previously, I knew website creation just well enough to make a bland website with paragraphs of content. I now know how to format the page in a way that is visually appealing.

What I learned

I learned numerous troubleshooting strategies. Working on this project has taught me that every error has an impact. I've also learned that coding can be incredibly frustrating, but seeing the end result is worth all the effort. 

What's next for Empowering Girls To Code

I hope to add more languages to the topics covered and to provide different levels of learning that range from beginner to advanced. In the future, I would want to add games in order for content to be more easily retained. I want girls to feel that coding is fun, not a tedious task.

Inspiration:


The technology workplace is a collaborative environment. It requires team members to be ready for changes and be creative in finding solutions. However, students who go into computing fields tend to be reserved with their passions and less inclined to reach out for opportunities with their peers.

This obviously leads to a problem in the workplace, not only for the timid individuals but also their employers. 

This issue is not something that can be solved through workshops and seminars.The best practices of cooperation are learned by actively removing oneself from their comfort zone. 


Methods: 
Our hack consistently creates the maximum amount of unique compatible teams. We envision at the most basic level, teachers grouping students so that they learn to work well with other people, making sure the students can apply their knowledge from the classroom and contribute to large scale projects. These students will be more effective in the tech workplace. 


Administrators who look to better utilize the diversity of their team members can implement this software to effortlessly foster a more inclusive and collaborative social environment.

Safe Haven,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133631-safe-haven,An anonymous chatroom that allows a safe space for users to ask questions regarding topics such as religion and politics.,11/10/2019 10:54:35,"Inspiration

So, this hack was inspired by stories told to me by people I know. Often times people are curious about someone's culture, religion, etc., but the issue with this is that many times the people who are asked these questions have usually been asked them before and get tired of answering them. That's why we thought that Safe Haven would be perfect for people to ask questions regarding topics they're unfamiliar with anonymously.

What it does

Safe Haven is a private chatroom for topics such as the environment, politics, culture, and religion. Within each topic are further subtopics to help users narrow down what they're looking for. For instance, under religion there would be subsections of various beliefs (e.g. Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Catholicism), and within those subsections will be a brief summary of each and a function to enter a chatroom to ask questions about that topic. Also, within each specific religion subsection will be a tab for a page with general questions and answers.

How we built it

We attempted to build it using Android Studio, as well as html, css, javascript, and a text editor.

Challenges we ran into

Limited coding ability was a big one. We tried our best to make our hack functional, but our limited ability to code a functioning app/website was a major issue.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of the idea itself and how it has the potential to make a huge impact and bring communities together through learning.

What we learned

We learned that we need to work on our coding skills, specifically coding for app and web development.

What's next for Safe Haven

The actual development of the app/website.

Student Debt Simulator,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133637-student-debt-simulator,"College students are currently facing a debt crisis, this simulation allows students to better prepare themselves for paying off the debt through a fun interactive game.",11/10/2019 10:55:42,"Inspiration

The issue of financial health as a young adult pursuing secondary education in the United States was brought to our attention by the amount of Seniors in our school talking about getting scholarships to pay for college. Many of our classmates often express feelings of uncertainty and fear when planning for their financial future.

What it does

The app simulates the time it takes for a student to pay off debt with real life elements such as sudden expenses, financial investment, budgeting, and personal well-being.  

How I built it

We first decided to look for a problem that was prevalent in the United States, we found student debt to be a serious issue. To address this issue we brainstormed several ideas such as a budgeting app, debt calculator, and finally the decided to pitch the idea of a student debt simulator. To gauge the audience of high school students, we created polls on Instagram with a following of strictly high school students and found many people to agree that a game which simulates student debt would help them better understand the concept. We then prototyped the UI & UX in Figma, and mined raw data using Oracle SQL Developer to construct the skeleton of the Android app. We then transferred data from a SQL database into ThingSpeak (IoT). Finally, to validate our product, we showed the prototype to several mentors to seek advice on UI and UX design, and back-end coding. 

Challenges I ran into

We spent several hours trying to find a way to code the front end of the an android app. We had used App Inventor before, however we felt that it would not meet the UI and UX expectations of the app, nor reach the machine capabilities we wanted. We then looked at making a web app in App Maker by Google, and found that we did not have access to such a program. To mediate this we looked to make a web app in FireBase but found the nature of the program to be unsuitable for our front-end coding needs.  Finally we decided to make the prototype of our app first to make sure we had time to display everything we had conceptualized on paper. As the hackathon came to an end, we realized we did not have enough time to create the app, but decided to demonstrate proof of concept, and research Oracle SQL database, data mining, basic machine learning, and data visualization through an IoT. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I believe we gained the most knowledge in creating an interface through mentors and workshops. We used color schemes, icons, and shadows to make our app look more modern. The app prototype is really thorough and can serve as a demo without data. Overall the design of the prototype is realistic to a real app that would be on the market, and is usable and simple. 

What I learned

We learned how to use Figma really thoroughly, as well as get a concept of what data mining, and machine learning could look like on the small scale. 

What's next for Student Debt Simulator

We'd like to implement the prototype through Android-Studio, ThingSpeak, and External Databases such as Firebase. We'd also like to add a personal element of the app, such as a bitmoji by connecting it to Snapchat through Snapkit.

Safe Haven,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133638-safe-haven,Safe Haven is an iOS based app that uses crowd sourced volunteers to match temporary housing with families affected by natural disasters.,11/10/2019 10:55:49,"Inspiration- In 2018, an intense storm in the Ellicott City area dropped a large, abnormal amount of rainfall that gathered on impervious surfaces, creating a flash flood. Cars were swept down this new river that was once a road, the structural foundations of businesses were slammed into rubble, and homes were completely destroyed with their remnants being washed down stream. We were personnel affected by this disaster when some of our friends and family lost their homes. On social media, we saw a few people posting statuses saying that they were opening their homes to those in need, but the posts were hard to find among the torrent of news stories, well wishes, and photos of the disaster. We thought that there had to be a better way; we wanted to make a platform for those in our community who wanted to open their homes, where they could directly communicate their message to those in need and simplify the home finding process for victims.

As we started designing our app, we conducted research and realized the international implications of the platform we were creating. According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, 14 million people are displaced each year by natural disasters. Relief organizations, such as the Red Cross and Relief International, do not have enough resources to provide for every victim. We believe that the only way to solve this problem, one that had so drastically impacted our area and continues to impact societies around the world, was to create an app that mobilized communities on a grassroots level to ensure the maximization of resources and provide setter to as many individuals as possible. 

What it does- Safe Haven is an IOS based app that is designed to provide safe, comfortable temporary homes through crowdsourced volunteers for people who have been displaced by natural disasters. The goal is to reduce the difficulties that families and individuals face in the aftermath of these tragedies by allowing volunteers to open up their homes to help those in need and by matching these homes with the victims.

When the app initially opens, the user has two options: sign in or sign up. Sign in or sign up is based on email to  ensure user identity and security using Firebase (Google Cloud Platform). The user is then directed to the home page, where there can choose between four different options. 

The first option is an app guide, which leads to a screen explaining the usage of and the purpose of the app. The next option is  “Find a Haven.” If the user is in need of a home, they can select this button which will redirect them to a map with the relative location of available homes with a radius of their present location. By clicking on the relative location marker of an available home, the user can retrieve the contact information of a specific haven near them. Using the app, the user can message the homeowner to request a home and discuss terms of their stay. The address can only be given by the homeowners themselves to ensure the safety of the users.  

Another option on the home screen is “Register a Haven.” If a user is willing to offer their home, they can register their house by clicking on this button. The user will then be asked to input their name, phone number, address, the number of occupants they can house, and the number of days they can offer their home. The inputted data will be stored in a secure backend Airtable, with the user’s address and other private information only being given out with the direct and explicit consent of the homeowner. 

The last option is a donate button which can be used to give money to Safe Haven’s cause. When users click on this button, they will be redirected to a GoFundMe page where they can easily make a contribution to help provide resources including food, water, and first aid essentials to affected areas.

How we built it- We built the app by combining web api, google cloud platform (Firebase), Airtable, and web api, while coding through Thunkable with loops, conditionals, user authentication, and data calling. We overcame our problems by asking for help, persisting, and working off of our team's strengths.

Challenges we ran into- A major difficulty we faced when creating the app were connecting the location feature to the map and having the map plot the relative location (rather than exact address) of users who input the address of their home, which was internally converted into coordinates of latitude and longitude. Our first solution used Firebase, which couldn’t complete all the functions relating to relative location, so we had to switch over to a combination of Firebase and Airtable (a spreadsheet database hybrid). Using this Fire-Air hybrid, we found the implementation of our platform to be much easier as we could retrieve information by referring to a specific cell within our “spreadsheet database” linked with user ID.

Armed with this new tool, we finally solved the problem by retrieving the user data from the secure database through the usage of a loop and WebAPI that gathered the name and host preferences to pair with the retrieved relative location (real location plus ""distorting function"").  This allowed the map to display retrieved information from the API and database to plot map markers in the appropriate location. When the map marker is clicked, the homeowner’s contact information will be displayed by a function calling the information, allowing the home finder to contact the homeowner at their discretion.

Accomplishments that we're proud of- We are incredibly proud of our overall concept for the app, as well as our ability to overcome the challenges we faced. There is an increasing need for communities to come together to unite for good, and we are very that our can help facilitate this interaction.

What we learned- We learned about the implementation and usage of WebAPIs in order to take data from a database and translate it onto an app platform. We also learned about the backend integration of an app that allows for communication between third party sources.

What's next for Safe Haven- With version two of the app, it would be our goal to increase the accessibility of the app to those who need it by creating an Android version. We also want to improve our services by partnering with local law enforcement agencies and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. By collaborating with departments that are dedicated to on-site relief efforts, we can maximize Safe Haven’s impact by combining physical and digital service. These agencies are also experts in what they do, meaning that having a close relationship with them would allow our app to receive specialized feedback to directly improve our functionality for the betterment of our users. Specifically, with our coalition with local law enforcement agencies, we can not only maintain the cyber security of our users, but also the personal safety because if anything on the off chance were to go wrong, we would have a direct line of communication with an organization designed to handle and neutralize situations. We would also like to fix the bugs and clean the rough edges of our app.

technicAnatomy,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133642-technicanatomy,technicAnatomy aims to teach students anatomy and physiology in an interactive VR environment. ,11/10/2019 10:56:16,"Inspiration

The inspiration behind this project is wanting to build something that can make a difference in the way students learn. We wanted to make something that can enhance a students learning experience by allowing them interact with the subject in a VR environment. 

What it does

technicAnatomy is a Virtual Reality application hosted on the Oculus Quest. It is an application for learning anatomy and is aimed at any student who needs to learn Anatomy, such as; medical students, nursing students, occupational therapist students, etc.  Within the application, the user will be placed in a medical exam room environment where a human body is found and the parts of the body are interactive. The student can select which ever organ they wish to exam and interact with it. Audio will be provided upon organ selection to provide the student with information on their selection. 

How we built it

We used Unity3D as the platform to build the VR environment and we used C# as the driver for the back-end development. We used blender to 3D render the human body and the organs. As a team, we started by brainstorming how we would implement the project. Next, we each worked on different components and put it together and troubleshooted as a team. 

Challenges we ran into

Our first challenge was setting up a collaborative environment for the team to start working together. With the Wifi issues we were having, it made it difficult to start the project. To rectify this issue, we moved to a local Starbucks to work until the internet issue was resolved. We also ran into issues grabbing the object and interacting with them. Some objects become displaced after selecting it. Due to time constraints, we were unable to completely rectify this issue. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

3 of us have never developed a VR application. We are extremely proud to have been able to accomplish setting up the environment, 3D rendering the assets, and ultimately have a functioning VR environment that a user can interact with.

What we learned

On the technical end, we learned how to 3D render objects using blender as well as using C# and Unity to build the environment. We learned to collaborate and brainstorm together as a team as well troubleshoot issues together. 

What's next for technicAnatomy

Upon further development, we can really make technicAnatomy a full app for students to use. We will fix the issues that we were unable to fix during this time at Technica and we will add more features and functionality. We want to go beyond just organ interaction. We want to allow the user to select a piece of anatomy to further dissect that piece all the way to its cellular lever.

 I made my system more secure by identifying and fixing some of the vulnerabilities. Many of these vulnerabilities were ""info"" which means they're just informational and not necessarily a risk, however some had small fixes to my PC involved. A major challenge was getting the scan to initially work because before, it could not find any hosts. However, once I overcame this, I was only able to fix a few vulnerabilities because many of them did not have a direct solution. For example I fixed some local security checks and blocking port 22.

BlazeTracker,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133657-blazetracker,Hundreds are displaced by wildfires in California; this number is only increasing. Our app is designed to help those affected by these fires with live updates and connect them with their community. ,11/10/2019 10:58:23,"Inspiration

As climate change continues to affect all of us as time goes on, people in California have felt the effects directly. We wanted to help alleviate the problem of local wildfires that displace hundreds of people in California by providing a service to connect those directly affected with people in their community willing to open up their homes to those in need. We believe that community is an integral part of moving through hardships, and we wanted to utilize technology to take the best advantage of a community.

What it does

Our app allows the user to create an account to connect them with those living around them. People that are affected by the fires can use the interactive map to get live updates on the severity of the fires near them, as well as other useful information for evacuation and protocol. Those unaffected can open up their homes to provide refuge for people evacuating and post a listing on the app. 

How we built it

We built this app using MIT App Inventor. This programming environment allowed us to use block-based tools to create an interactive Android App and implement the necessary features we intended our app to have by using design tools.

Challenges we ran into

While creating this app, we were challenged by the database used to store the information about new account users. We were also challenged by coming up with the best way to use technology to solve the problem we were addressing.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the fact that we were able to design a functional user interface as well as design aspects of the app. We designed the layout and logo of the app.

What we learned

We learned how to use block-based programming to create a functional android app. We also learned more about how databases work and how to store information in the long term, as well as how to connect a username to a password.

What's next for BlazeTracker

In the future, we hope to learn more about database usage so that we can successfully create accounts on the app. We would want to work on getting live updates on fires, as well as possibly opening up our app to other locations and for other natural disasters.

Breadbox Design Project,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133661-breadbox-design-project,Now it is getting extremely difficult to have important financial conversations with young people. We created an interactive and fun way to improve financial literacy and savings,11/10/2019 10:58:37,"Inspiration

From the users we have interviewed, a lot of young people have trouble with financial literacy and making more beneficial financial decisions. We decided to incorporate the processes of gamification and money management into Breadbox! An app that challenges young people to save money, adopt beneficial spending habits, and win unique prizes.

What it does

We created an interactive and fun tool to help people challenge their friends and save money with Breadbox. The first step is to create a user profile to create goals of how much the user wants to save and to create custom savings plans that they can challenge to do themselves or with others. With different categories such as food, shopping, and transportation, you can choose which area you want to save the most from. And each category offers financial tips that can improve your overall financial literacy. By creating teams with your friends, you can customize or use the built in features to set financial goals, cut down on spending, and win prizes when you save the most money. Whether you win or loose, you still have some cash in your pocket.  

How I built it

Using the Sketch tool, we were able to layout our prototype to showcase the different functions the app has to offer. With different icons and visuals, we were able to show step-by-step how you can create your profile, set your financial goals, invite friends to challenge you, and sync your bank to that you can enjoy your prizes and savings. With our data collected from our users and the prototype tools from Sketch and Principle, we were able to create different scenarios of Breadbox. Then, we documented our process through PowerPoint to show our design and thinking process through the course of this project.  

Challenges I ran into

Some of the challenge we ran into was our sample size. With the time constraints and getting a limited number of interviews from users, we only received just enough to create a prototype that will be fun and interactive to our current audience. 

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

We are most proud of taking such a broad topic and being able to narrow it down into a feasible solution that can potentially change online banking apps. We were able to bring our skills together in a short period of time to help young people learn more about how important being financially literate is and how these challenges can go a long way. 

What we learned

We learned that when it comes to UX designs, that there are always changes to be made. We hope that our challenge will be considered and fine-tuned into a real application that can help young people with learning about managing their financial goals. 

What's next for Breadbox Design Project

What's next for us is to get user feedback and iterate!

What it does The app creates a todo list based on current grade in the class, grade weight for assignments, time of completion, level of difficulty of the professor and smaller priority levels. Once each of the conditions is compared against, the app shows what assignments are best to do in order with the student able to choose which to tasks to progress in.

How we built it We used Android Studio and Java to complete the application

Challenges we ran into A lot of us were unfamiliar with git and some aspects of android studio pertaining to connecting pages, background schemes, java files, classes etc, but we definitely powered through by reading, applying programming knowledge and asking questions to some of the mentors here at Technica.

Accomplishments that we're proud of being able to have a completely working application from us going above and beyond!

Our inspiration was that we wanted to create a machine learning algorithm. Both AI and drones are a hot topic these days, so we thought it would be fun to do a project combining the two.

What it does

This project is a comprehensive overview of using deep-learning-based object detection methods for Lunar simulation field imagery via drones.

How we built it

We used Python OpenCV and pre-existing code that we modified to detect a specific item on the terrain.

Challenges we ran into

It was difficult using OpenCV since it was a new experience, and what was even more difficult was this new concept of machine learning and trying to wrap our heads around the algorithms that can be confusing to understand for the first time.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're very proud of the fact that we have a model that can train and test for polar bears on a terrain, and all of us learned so many new things related to neural networks. 

What we learned

We explore some of these applications along with challenges in the automation of drone-based monitoring through deep learning.

What's next for Game of Drones - ASRC Federal

We want to improve our code so that it can classify more than two states. In other words, instead of determining whether a polar is or is not in the picture, we want to know what type of item is in the picture. We'd also like to detect images and track it on the screen, rather than only confirm its existence.

Hermes,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133672-hermes,A travel app that helps tourists thrive and appreciate foreign countries. ,11/10/2019 10:59:37,"Inspiration

When traveling, a tourist has to research the culture of the foreign nation in order to prevent embarrassing cultural misunderstandings and download multiple apps (such as a currency converter and a translation app) in an attempt to survive in a foreign land. These tasks overburden tourists that are traveling abroad to escape the business and stress of life.

What it does

The app determines the tourist's location using Google Maps and provides tourists with information on the values, traditions, and etiquette of the nation they are visiting. It also contains a table of common phrases with their translation in the foreign country's language. The app gives the tourist the option to change the country and language so that they can look at the customs of other nations and see common phrases translated into other languages. 

How we built it

We brainstormed the features that we wanted our app to have and then listed the tasks that we needed to accomplish in order to have each feature. Next, we delegated the tasks and developed our application.

Challenges we ran into

We had a lot of issues with deprecated classes and methods. We found a lot of tutorials and examples code online and were not able to use it because it had methods are now deprecated. 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are very proud of the fact that we were able to determine the tourist's location using the Google Maps API. It took us 12 hours to get this process to work because we had difficulty getting the API key to work. It took us a while to figure out that we needed to make a new key for each file in the software. 

What we learned

We learned how to create a database on mySequl. This database was used to store information on different cultures. We also learned how to connect APIs to websites and use the Google Maps API. 

What's next for Hermes

We plan to add a feature that will allow natives to edit the cultural information about their country and provide travel advice. We would expand our website so that it would include information on more countries and translations in more languages.

In a recent conference held in France about the current status of the climate crisis, a concerning statistic came out which stated that we had only 12 years left to drastically reduce our carbon emission and prevent catastrophic climate consequences. As a group, we figured that the best way to move towards positive change was to inform as many people as we could about the severity of this crisis and what they can do on their own to help reduce their carbon emissions. 

What it does

We built a web app that allows users to answer questions related to how often they use regular household appliances. The app also gives the user information on how much carbon is emitted by each appliance and alternatives to using them to make a change.

How we built it

We built our web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Challenges we ran into

One major challenge we faced in the process of creating our web app was adding a drop down menu to collect user input regarding how often they use different household appliances. Our web app required us to use both CSS and HTML and implement them into each other which was difficult because we're unfamiliar with these programming languages.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We successfully navigated how to use entirely new programming languages that we were unfamiliar with which is an accomplishment in itself. We used various animations to add a dynamic element to our web page and to make it more interactive with the user.

What we learned

Not only did we learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during this whole proceess but we also learned how to organize ourselves and work together as an efficient team.

What's next for Pollution Manager

We want to expand the reach of our website by targeting those in power and voters.

Electronic Suture Diagrams,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133713-electronic-suture-diagrams,This is a simplified version of the sutures a robot 'hand' could execute in real life during surgeries. ,11/10/2019 11:21:12,"Inspiration

In surgery, surgeons are required to have very steady and precise hands that are in control of someone’s life; one slip up can be fatal. A fundamental skill that surgeons must learn is the art of suturing. There are multiple kinds of techniques that can be used in surgery such as a horizontal mattress suture or a simple interrupted suture. Surgeons learn these techniques in their intern or residency years. 

What it does

It displays one of three different types of sutures based on the user input.

How we built it

This project was built with VIPO (i.e. Variables Input Process Output) and conditional statements of java.

Challenges we ran into

Our original plan was to create a prosthetic hand that could be programmed to do these precise and delicate sutures as long as the surgeon or OR nurses enters in the suture technique into the computer. Of course, we do not have the hardware or the 3D printer to create the hand, but instead, we decided to show how the suture techniques are done through simple Java programming.
We also ran into some trouble with software to compile and run our code; not only did we not have access to a code compiler for the majority of the hackathon, we also had to try to fix errors we did not know how to fix, which we ended up not being able to fix either due to the unreliability of the alternative java compiler or incorrect code.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the fact that we wrote a code related to reducing risks of surgery by taking advantage of the precision of technology.

What we learned

We learned about the proper way to use VIPO as well as how technology can be applied to real life situations

What's next for Electronic Suture Diagrams

The next step for Electronic Suture Diagrams would be to try and implement this code into a robot of some sort that would physically execute the code to make precise sutures during surgery.

$pendSmart,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133729-pendsmart,"An app that allows diverse, young, first-generation college students make safe & appropriate decisions when managing their personal finances & understanding the resources based on their understanding.",11/10/2019 11:26:55,"Inspiration

Being first generation college students, it is often hard to understand what it means to be financially responsible due to the lack of resources in our communities. Overall, as a college student, it is difficult to create responsible spending and saving habits without the appropriate resources directed to our limited understanding of finances.

What it does

$pendSmart is an interactive mobile app in which young individuals can follow their expenses, budget accordingly, achieve their financial goals, watch and follow interactive modules, and have their banking information all in one application.

How we built it

After conducting short surveys and a few interviews with selected Technica 2019 participants, we built an app design using Figma (presented via powerpoint) to represent the knowledge of our sample size and to align our goals with their values.

Challenges we ran into

None of our group members never used Figma, so it was an entire learning experience. Our group consists of 3 total students: 2 college students who are Neurobiology and Architecture majors and a high schooler. We are all interested in technology and computer science and took up a new hobby with using our creativity to design prototypes.

Accomplishments that we're proud of

We didn't give up when the application was getting difficult for us. It became frustrating since we are new to the designing/prototyping field. Having 3 students of completely different educational backgrounds was a unique experience.

What we learned

We learned a lot from trial and error, and learned how to intricately use applications like Figma and Invision. 

What's next for $pendSmart

Due to the short time constraint, we would like to continue building this prototype to see how far it goes. We all left with a new found interest in the integration of technology and finances so we are excited to see where this takes.

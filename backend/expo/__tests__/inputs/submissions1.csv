Beyond The Stars,https://technica2019.devpost.com/submissions/133134-beyond-the-stars,Our project is about the women in space.,11/09/2019 20:49:14,"inspiration

The thing that inspired us was the fact that so many more men have gone to space than women have.

What it does

The code/hack we made teaches people about the women who have gone to space and our website has games that are space themed that goes along with of our topic go beyond the stars and space.

How I built it

We used HTML, scratch, and CSS for the code to create this website.

Challenges I ran into

We couldn't figure out the code to change pictures, enter text, and add links.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I'm proud of the fact that we created something even though we are beginners.

What I learned

We learned that everyone has their own strengths and that there are many different ways to accomplish things.

What's next for Beyond The Stars

The next step for Beyond The Stars is to possibly turn it into an app in the future.

The 2019 technica theme

What it does

It shows some of what girls in code can do, and helps us envision our futures.

We began with basic website code that we had written in glitch previously and modified it to fit with the theme. We then created and enhanced our scratch games. Finally, we embedded our scratch projects into our website .

Challenges we ran into

Wifi and many distractions 

Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completing our website and reusing some of our previously written code.

What we learned

Teamwork skills!
